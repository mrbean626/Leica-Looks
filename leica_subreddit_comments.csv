As a owner fortunate enough to own black and chrome M7s, you‚Äôve made a GREAT choice, considering convenience of 

Aperture priority
Durability of a solid brass top plate
DX
Bright finder with LEDs that count-down long auto exposures
Long exposure power saving means you only need battery power to close the shutter at the end of your exposure
Frame selector lever

Probably the only two disadvantages are
Not everyone repairs them (I use DAG)
Rangefinder framing isn‚Äôt accurate

This shot of Cadiz, Spain has a moody, atmospheric vibe that really works. The boats in the foreground add depth and interest, while the cloudy sky creates a dramatic backdrop. The composition is solid, with the shoreline and breakwater nicely framing the scene.

The foreground feels slightly underexposed, so brightening it up a tad might help balance the overall exposure? Also, maybe experiment with a longer exposure next time to smooth out the water for a different effect.

Overall though, apart from some nit critiquing, nice shot, and hey, if you like it, that's sometimes all that counts! Nice photo, overall. WOW.

lryi8nj,Dufffader,"What lens do you usually shoot with? 

For me it boils down to 3 things. I would say the M2 is optimized for 35mm because you have just one frameline at a time. I guess it might also work for 50mm but I have an M3 as well, which works even better. If you want an all rounder to use 35mm to 135mm, then M4 is the easy answer. I use my M2 the most because I love 35mm. 

The rewind knob is a preference. I like the slower but sturdier rewind knob rather than a crank. 

And last one is the film advance. M4 has that plastic tip that pivots to provide better ""grip"". But I prefer the single piece of metal on the M2 and M3.

M2 feels more like a simple raw camera to park your 35mm lens. M4 is more like a more versatile camera with usage enhancement built in.",3,1728949020.0,2024-10-14 23:37:00,,0,1g3ts3u

lrywbob,Ready_Blueberry_6836,"I have them both.   The M4 is a bit better in my opinion.   The differences are quite minimal as far as camera use goes.  The M4 loading system is easier, but I have (even as a ten year veteran) shot a whole roll and found the film wasn't loaded properly.  I did that just this week and it is a downer.   You won't do that with the M2.   It does take an extra step or two to load..  
The M2 rewind knob is better but not a big deal.  It is a little more difficult, but feels more solid.  I also prefer the manual feel of the counter.  I like the M4 plastic film advance.  The M2 one hits my shutter speed dial and it annoys me. 

The biggest deal is my M4 is black chrome and in better shape.  I use it way more.   My M2 is a silver beater.  The connection you feel to the camera is a much bigger issue than the M4 vs M2.",2,1728954341.0,2024-10-15 01:05:41,,0,1g3ts3u

I was also thinking whether it wouldn't be better to take the M11, but I chose the M10-R, last Saturday I made a deal.

Over the past few days I've noticed the advantages:

* image resolution - detail is insane
* great tonal range especially in shadows
* beautiful colours, I practically don't have to fix anything in post-production
* I didn't notice any delays, all functions work smoothly.
* clear menu, no unnecessary gadgets, I can focus on photography not setup
* fits great in the hand - but definitely will buy thumb grip for additional support
* I love the rangefinder, focusing is super easy for me

I had an M6 that had a ""sticky"" rangefinder patch when focusing, it would snap in to place after a few seconds. Just needed a dab of lube and it's been good for years.

Would not hurt to have a full CLA, but if you are handy, there is probably a guide out there to self-lube it. I've done it on the M10 and M6, it was super easy on both.

ls03rrc,DigitalHeMan,"With focus issues, especially closer focus, there are a number of things you can check. It's a bit harder with film as you can't see immediate results, but still possible.

  
- If you can, check with a second lens, this helps determine if it's a lens problem, or a camera problem. Alternatively, if you have a friend with a (digital) M, see how the lens performs on their camera.

- Check infinity focus. Find an object in the far distance, like a couple of miles away, and put the lens on infinity. You should have a perfectly crisp image in the viewfinder. If you don't, it suggests your infinity focus is off and this can lead to problems through the whole range which are most noticeable at closer range

- Check technique. Often with portraits, the focus patch is in the wrong place, so we focus, and then readjust the framing (for example you focus on the eyes, but then don't want the eyes in the center of the image, so you move the camera right/left/up/down). If you do this, you are changing the distance from camera to focus point. If you're using a wide open lens at a short focus distance, even a half inch shift can lead to missed focus. In these situations, either don't shoot wide open so that you have a bit more depth of field, or keep the eyes in the center of the image, and crop the image in the (digital) darkroom.

- If you've done all this and are still having a problem, the focusing can be adjusted. There are tutorials out there, but also repair companies who can help (not sure where you're located, but I can provide suggestions)",1,1728974647.0,2024-10-15 06:44:07,,0,1g3ncj6

It is the single best way to start repairing cameras. Contrary to what a lot of people seem to think, there are no quick fixes or shortcuts. You have to start with the very basics (like instamatics etc) and work your way up to more complex mechanisms. That route will also make you acquire the necessary tools along the way. You don't need expensive equipment like custom tools or shutter testers to start repairing the basic cameras like instamatics or box cameras but as soon as you start getting into the more complex cameras, you'll have to start investing into testing equipment to do a proper job. 

Plenty of cowboys out there who pick up a screwdriver and think they can repair everything that comes their way. You wouldn't believe the 'DIY' stuff camera techs see on a daily basis (even from 'professionals' aka DIYers who dare to charge people).

To be short about it, I hated focusing with it. I wear glasses and couldn‚Äôt see particularly well in the finder and the patch itself was a pain to make out. I‚Äôve loved SLRs for about my whole life and so the R4s was my first analog Leica, followed recently by the Leicaflex SL.

I love both those cameras very much, and the finder in the SL particularly so, but I was in Leica Store Miami a few months back with my Q and mentioned not jiving with the rangefinder. They brought out an M4 for me to try and immediately I knew I was getting an analog M in the near future. I decided on an M3 because for me it‚Äôs 28mm and 50mm just about all the time. And as I always zone focus with 28, and external finder is great for this since the finder in the M3 is basically 50mm from edge to edge.

I‚Äôve got a test roll in now making sure everything is operating just fine and hope to bond with it this coming week with a trip to New York City. The few exposures I‚Äôve made so far have not felt too different in focusing from the Leicaflex SL. But the operation of the camera is nicer I think. I‚Äôll find out soon enough if this is for me.

That being said, when I am in a low light and classic mood I very often reach for the Light Lens Lab 50mm f/1.2 1966 as it has a more classic rendering with less effective coatings. It is a high quality lens, expensive for a Chinese lens but cheaper than a Leica. I like them so much I bought 2. You can find them on eBay still. 

  
Of the Light Lens Lab and the Noctilux, the Noctilux is more is a more versatile lens but I definitely prefer the wide open look of Light Lens Lab between the two.

I own and love the 50/12. It's probably my favorite 50. I use it alongside a Lux 50 ASPH. It's a beautiful lens at all apertures. It's painterly and soft and gentle at wide apertures, and then from f/2.8 or so it becomes quite normal and reliable, but still with a special way of rendering colors and backgrounds. It's not unlike the Steel Rim reissue, in that it's two lenses in one. 

I think it could be my only 50, but for one thing‚Äîthe very long focus throw. It is slow to focus compared to other lenses. So, while it's optically fantastic (if you're looking for the look it offers), I wouldn't think it would necessarily be the best street lens. That's not to say you couldn't use it! Only that you'd have to be relatively slow and deliberate with it, compared to your APO.

I myself have been dreaming of selling my Lux ASPH to get a used 50 APO, because the APO + 50 f/1.2 pair seems (to me) like owning the pinnacle of Leica's new and old 50mm offerings. So I get the appeal of that pair. But it's a significant investment, so I'd go slow and think seriously about the kind of aesthetic you want. Are you looking for modern + dreamy (f/1 or f/0.95), or vintage + dreamy (1.2)?

lrzqww3,Broken_Perfectionist,"Perhaps this is an unfavorable observation but Leica‚Äôs reputation was built upon the Barnacks, M3, MP, M2, and M4. Both Youxin Ye and Sherry Krauter say that the M4 (Sherry‚Äôs favorite) was the last classically made Leica. These cameras, at the time, were THE professional cameras to have before the Nikon F came along. The mystique and legendary reputation originated from these cameras. After the M4, they tried changing the manufacturing location, took cost cutting measures, they tried to change the design with the M5 and then the M6 with the zinc top, they just took a different direction to try and survive in an evolving photographic industry. Leica was an astounding collection of mechanical engineers, optical engineers, highly skilled machinists, metalworkers, and humane and brave leadership that guided them through WWII (look up Leica Freedom Train when you get a chance). They seriously pursued perfection and technical excellence even if it led them toward bankruptcy. In my opinion, the classically built Leicas, the M4 and earlier, deserve their reputation as the highest quality tool for the job. After that, they started the slow drift towards the luxury brand that we know of today. The first M that I‚Äôve handled was an M6. It‚Äôs nice but it doesn‚Äôt quite feel as good as my M4. It also doesn‚Äôt feel as precise as my IIIc. 

All the cameras you‚Äôve listed, in my opinion, came about during a more modern era of Leica and maybe that‚Äôs the source of your disconnect? Perhaps your idea of a ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù Leica fan is tied to the old Leica or the old school photographers that used the classically built Leicas. Maybe it‚Äôs time to let that go ‚Ä¶ or try out an M4 üòÅ.

They're all sharp and modern in rendering and what I really like is that they are compact and light. So in most days they are the lens I have on my M. I guess in the future interchangeable lenshood and cap between certain models may be useful, but I've not had any need for that yet.

Another option you might run into is the Soviet turret finder, but the 28mm and 35mm settings - while surprisingly clear and useable - are both somewhat wider than the real FOV, I find. I think it's closer to 25mm and 30-32mm. Maybe the original Zeiss ones were a bit tighter.

lrqzdax,Groguistheway,I think this is partially right. When it comes to color (other than possible Hasselblad that actually color calibrates each camera at the factory and has higher bit depth) any camera can be mostly made to look like any other camera. The difference with the Leica‚Äôs is their lens design. In general the Leica lenses are designed so that they have lower micro contrast in the out of focus rendering and outside the center of the frame. The 3d ‚Äúpop‚Äù is mostly how the lenses are extremely sharp in the center while having lower contrast and pleasing falloff. Most lenses from the big three are designed to be consistent across the frame which is the more modern rendering but ends up being flat.  This does then mean you can get a lot of the Leica look by putting their glass on any camera but then you do miss out on any in body corrections.,2,1728840790.0,2024-10-13 17:33:10,,0,1g2tv5g

lrocjdd,35mm-dreams-,"u/kentzler assuming your rangefinder and lens is calibrated normally, getting parts of subjects in focus with an aperture of F/1.4 is possible but challenging. 
First of all the depth of field at F/1.4 is very thin. Even if your subjects breathe or bob their head slightly you can miss focus after gaining focus. Thats the challenge of using F/1.4. About a month or two ago, i picked up my rangefinders after a long lay off, bought a 35mm Summilux FLE right away to pair with the MP & paired my M-A with a 50mm Summilux F/1.4. I purchased B+W 3 stop ND filter and about 10 rolls of Portra 160 from B&H. Its easier to shoot wide open on film because of the thicker film plane. 
I proceeded to expose about 8 rolls just using F/1.4. Sure i missed focus a bunch of times but also got better at it over time. 
Clean the optical and rangefinder window. If it‚Äôs smudged, it will lower contrast and create blur when focusing. 
Secondly use higher shutter speeds. In my case in broad daylight i was able to use shutter speeds of 1/500 and 1/1000 at F/1.4 with the ND filter attached. 
Move with your subject. They might not stand still so gently rock back and forth in sync with their movements. Usually a fraction of a movement makes a big difference. 
I depress the shutter at the height of a full inspiration. 
For kids, it helps if they are distracted eg. Holding candy or a toy and then you pre focus and when you call them and they look at you grab the shot. 
By using F/1.4 a great deal, eventually you can focus on a brim of a hat or hair and just rock forward and gain focus on an eye. You will become familiar with the fraction of movements needed to gain focus. This is better than moving the focus ring back and forth.",1,1728794703.0,2024-10-13 04:45:03,,0,1g2appj

lrprfzr,syrcular,"There‚Äôs a lot of great observations, advice and tips on rangefinder photography here!  I wish I had run into this post about a year ago!  I agree with a lot of the comments here.  For me it came down to practice, muscle memory and changing my expectations on sharpness the way modern cameras achieve it.  I struggled shooting with M‚Äôs for the last two years and even bought and sold M bodies over frustration especially with the M11 with no IBIS and high resolution and also being a glasses wearer.  But you eventually through trial and error, start nailing focus more consistently.  I now can confidently get almost 80-85% keeper rates and I developed a bit of muscle memory so that even with wearing glasses which can be challenging to use rangefinders with, I‚Äôm able to nail focus just by distance, feel and visual cues.  However I see distance well without glasses so sometimes to help with my composition I do take my glasses off.  Especially for portrait work.  But I also own a visoflex which helps a lot and agree for critical focus it can be very helpful.  
The Leica M is very much an instrument and not a device.  But I can assure you through practice you eventually get it but it take awhile but you can even achieve as sharp pics as some autofocus cameras however as many have mentioned, that‚Äôs not the point of the M.  You learn to embrace the imperfections and character.  Lastly, as others have mentioned.  The Summilux lenses (I own both the 35 and 50 close focus versions) are softer wide open than conventional f/1.4 lenses you get from Sony or Canon.  Some more than others and it also depends on what the subject distance is.  For instance my 50 lux has been the most frustrating lens for me.  Close up seems to yield a softer image while mid and infinity distance shots produce sharper images.  
You‚Äôll get used to the specifics nuances of your lenses as well.  If you want Sony, Canon Nikon level sharpness you can always explore options like the APO lenses but they are insanely expensive and are much more clinical. As I say with most people like me who struggled for a long while, stick with it and one day just like that, it will click.",1,1728825638.0,2024-10-13 13:20:38,,0,1g2appj

lrrfo24,Professional_Sun4455,"If you are not catching focus then setup a test at home:

1. Shoot lens wide open with rangefinder on a tripod at some detailed target where focus is certain, like a lens test chart. 
2. Shoot with live view on same camera on tripod.
3. Repeat same test with another lens of similar depth of field (ie focal length and aperture the same)

Comparing these will give a sense of if it is the rangefinder is out of whack or your lens helicoid needs adjustment.

If it's your technique then a little practice will be cheaper than a needless repair.

I explored the Leica M10 with a 35mm Summilux f/1.4 FLE I. I loved the experience (similar to the way I shoot my M6) but the results of my pics are... mixed. I don't know if I'm expecting more of the 24MP of the M10, or I'm still bad at focusing, but the photos with the lens are not as sharp as I expected them.

lrmt96a,jumpinthruhoops,"When I first got my M11 kit, I had the same feeling (also shoot Sony). A few things to keep in mind:  
- Nailing focus on a rangefinder, especially at something like 1.4 or 2.0 or 2.8 requires VERY GOOD eyesight. I thought mine was fine - turns out it wasn't as perfect as it needed to be. Once I got a diopter correction for the viewfinder and glasses, I significantly increased my razor sharp images. Remember, you're not relying on auto-focus or even focus peaking here.  
- Keep in mind that the depth of field at 1.4-4.0 is VERY small depending on your distance from the subject. This leaves very little wiggle room for missing focus. Get an app like photo pills to check and start to memorize those distances and what they feel like in the real world.  
- Leica's lenses are very small, which means there is little room for the type of corrections you can do in the optical design of much larger lenses. Compare your FLE to the Sony 35 1.4 GM for example. But you pay for Leica because of that size. The Sony 35 GM is VERY sharp by design. The Summilux is explicitly not clinically sharp at 1.4 by design (it has a glow to it). I'd rather still carry around my Leica kit.  
- At some point, you need to think about how zoomed in do you need to be to judge a picture. 200-300% is not useful because it makes absolutely no difference to social media, most screens from normal viewing distances, or printing.  
- If all else fails, throw some sharpening on the photo in your post-processing workflow.",10,1728771616.0,2024-10-12 22:20:16,,0,1g2appj
lrne345,iskosalminen,"As someone coming from Sony system as well, outside of what u/jumpinthruhoops already said [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/1g2appj/comment/lrmt96a/), I've also noticed few things:

1. **Lack of stabilization** ‚Äì I've shot with modern Sony bodies for so long I had forgotten how to shoot with cameras without IBIS. With Sony and modern smart phones you can pretty much shoot handheld in any light and not pay attention to the camera sway or shake at all. But with Leica M's you can't rely on IBIS and instead have to remember to keep the camera steady.
2. **Focus on focusing** ‚Äì with Sony I could move my body and camera around a bit and the AF would keep everything in focus, not so much with manual focus. I was out shooting today and caught myself focusing the lens on a park bench and then slightly repositioning myself for a better angle, putting the bench slightly out of focus. With 1.4f even slight movement/sway of your body can mess up the focus.
3. **There's sharpness and then sharpness** ‚Äì the modern Sony/Canon/etc lenses are absolute beasts when it comes to sharpness, and so is the AF systems they use. They even focus on the iris instead of the eye to get even tack more sharper. Film cameras and range finders aren't supposed to compete with that kind of sharpness. 

Personally I've noticed that I've had to adjust my expectations. I don't expect clinical, laboratory level sharpness at 300% from a small, manual focus lens. I shoot with my Leica for the character of the images, size of the system, and how fun it is to shoot with.",6,1728779709.0,2024-10-13 00:35:09,,0,1g2appj

Bracing your left elbow into your body makes a big difference. 

That said, these days, a camera without IBIS is pretty much a non-starter for me, because of the very issue you're facing: everything is just a little softer than it _could_ be. It's fine, but I like to start with sharpness and take it away if I want. 

I remember when Canon came out with their stabilized lenses and the difference in sharpness was just stunning, even at high shutter speeds.

Well yes and no , not debating about the noctiluxes optical performance by itself  even thought to be honest the noctilux never wanted to be a tack  sharp in it‚Äôs own era , the Nikon is definitely sharper , but is freakin 2kg lens bigger than a telephoto  .

you simply forgot that  a lens is about physics and to Bend physics you have two routes , either by choosing the type of glass elements and the type of lens design ,  your average mirroless producer has a great andvantage compared to a Leica M that is having way less size and wheight  limits while a Leica M lens always had to be 300-500 grams  and tiny and short , a Sony G master  might be equal to a summilux 1.4 but the Sony had way more room( especially in length ) on the drawing board to make a lens desing that while being high performance was simply cheaper to make compared to 6k summilix , yeah the leica name has it‚Äôs own premium compared to other brands but for m lenses is not only a matter of that , you can see that in the pricing scheme that makes the 50mm  M lens the cheapest, and as it gets wider it gets way more expensive  because making optically corrected 1.4  lenses I‚Äôd definitely harder Than making telephoto lenses 

In lenses you don‚Äôt pay for pure performance , you always pay for a size/performance ratio , a clear example are sigma lenses they are sometimes cheaper than the equivalent top lens while performing more or less the same , but in that scenario they are almost always heavier 

Zeiss Otus when came out destroyed the whole lens game , but non without making 1kg long and wide lenses 

The Leica M 35 -50 APO have a crazy price tag , and while the Sl ones are still expensive they are 40% less expensive while having better performance than any other M lens why that happens ?

 For the wheight part 

Well mostly false , the enthusiast  i know usually don‚Äôt like to buy heavy lenses for the sake of performance they are more marketing driven , wedding photographers are somewhat more willing to buy heavy lenses since they keep running around with them 12 hours with no pause they are fairly happy if lens is lighter and well balanced on the camera , i care more about raw performance (which doesn‚Äôt mean mostly sharpness but many things) but from what I saw  only commercial shooters and fine art photographers(or artist if you prefer to call them that way )  don‚Äôt care about wheight as long their bodies allows them to shoot with it 

With that being said , Sony and canon (Nikon made the biggest lenses of all  but it has it‚Äôs own reason)  did their marketing reaserch and realized that  a lens with that certain  length and wheight is the  limit to sell the highest number of people and started building around that limits , Leica with the M camera simply couldn‚Äôt do that 

On the other hand I don‚Äôt know why they chose to make the Sl lens deliberately F2  compact  but  fairly heavy , and original zooms were super heavy for what they are , i don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs either the fact they have been made by an engineer without any marketing supervision or the fact that they thought heavy  and full metal lenses was the ‚Äò‚Äôthink different ‚Äò‚Äô move that Leica needed",1,1728850232.0,2024-10-13 20:10:32,,0,1g2appj

lrq5bde,jshell,"It's not total crap. It's a good camera. I like it enough that I bought a T in silver (pictured) and, a while later, got a TL2. I guess it depends on which model you're seeing and what comes with it.

I paid $450 for the T (original) about two years ago, and that came with a snap skin, a couple of the official wrist and neck straps (of which I'm not a fan), the 'attach your own strap' removable eyelets, full box and manuals, and extra batteries. I think for $450-$600, a T or TL is worth it. There's one on eBay selling right now with the Leica 18-56mm lens for around $970USD. That's worth it.

I paid $950 for my TL2 sometime in 2023. Also came with box and in great condition, but not as many accessories.

It's fun to use with manual lenses though my experience with the camera got a lot better when I added the VisoFlex Typ 020 viewfinder. And when you add that, the price (and relative size) on a TL2 gets awfully close to current SL Typ 601 prices. Which I think it the best looking of the SL series.

A good buy? I dunno, I feel ""good buy"" is subjective. I think they're beautiful. I think Leica genuinely tried to make something new and unique here. I think they were surprisingly bold, for once. And I think it works. There is a beautiful zen-like minimalism to the whole interface. Even though this line is dead, I think much of the modern UI in the SL, Q, and M series owes a lot to the T. And in general, I feel like the camera does what I really want it to do: it gets out of the way and just lets me shoot.

They're small, they're fun, they take good pictures, and ain't no other camera like them. On the pictures: the color JPEGs are often quite bland and boring but the DNGs are easy to work. I love the ""B+W High Contrast"" JPEGs straight out of camera. The T gets a bit too noisy past ISO 1600.

lrgwheb,L0rdGwynIII,"Not much to this post, just excited to buy my first Leica, an M2. I got into film somewhat recently, and after shooting my SLR (Olympus OM-4 Ti) for a while and feeling I wanted something more street friendly and faster to focus, I decided I ""needed"" a rangefinder. Did my homework and saw most non-Leica rangefinders are climbing in price, not quite the bargain they used to be, and the modest amount of money saved didn't seem worth it. I thought I'd just go all the way instead of the incremental approach, which would save money in the long run.

I wanted to go for an old school, brass internals, meterless Leica, as I want to learn to meter by eye. Initial thought was M4, but I preferred the black chrome over chrome for that model, which meant big money. Backup option was the M2, as I think it looks very good in chrome, and overall similar functionally to the M4. Another M2 perk is the isolated 35mm frame lines (as opposed to the paired 135mm on the M4).

This M2 popped up on eBay in my home state, purchased from a nice gentelman with an impressive collection. It was CLA'd around a year ago, so I was happy to avoid that cost / time and also avoid duties buying a Leica from outside the USA. I paid a bit extra for one in such good condition. It's not perfect, but pretty good for being over 60 years old, just a few nicks on the base plate and some small scratches on the back door paint. It's got character I say!

I decided to go for Leica glass right off the bat as well. Bought an Elmar 50mm f2.8 in very good cosmetic condition. There is some haze and the focus ring is a little sticky, so I am going to get it CLA'd by YYE. In the meantime, I have a cosmetically and optically mint 35mm Summicron V3 on the way :)

lriim9d,L0rdGwynIII,"Pricing is anywhere from $1,200 - $2,000 depending on condition.  I paid on the higher end of that spectrum given I was seeking on in great shape.  Also wanted to buy one in the USA that was CLA'd as I figured that would save me $4-500 and a lot of time, compared to buying one that hadn't been serviced outside the USA (most listing are from Japan).

  
If you don't mind the button rewind (some people seek the lever), this listing came up pretty shortly after I bought mine.  I definitely would have considered it, maybe even gone for it if I hadn't bought mine already, it is in great shape, near mint, recently CLA'd and the lens is too, I'm surprised it hasn't sold already.

I felt that moving from M10M to M11M, I had to ""re-learn"" the nuances of what the sensor captures. Despite the images being flat, they're full of information that can be manipulated in post processing.

I do have a Nikon F (lens) to Leica M (body) adapter, and a stack of AF-D and AIS lenses, together with several suitable filters.  So I might experiment with them first before settling on what to use with my Summicron.  So far, I've been pleased with the combination, and long term can only see myself looking for a faster or sharper 35mm depending which direction this new camera takes me.",1,1728773901.0,2024-10-12 22:58:21,,0,1g25kxk

OP - I do see a lot of hate towards the product, and it's kinda unfortunate, cuz you have obviously put some time and effort into doing it well. Seems to be a mix of things:

1) pretty divisive topic (covering the dot)

2) pricing

3) reddit users are pretty sensitive to self-promotion in subs. You're probably over-saturating the forum if the pitchforks are out. Maybe just means you have to find some other channels to explore to get the word out if you want to keep pursuing it. 

4) Some of your replies are getting a bit offensive. To say ""What a sad life"" to someone instead of just taking the criticism and moving on, feels like... not a good look. and probably not helping your brand.

The fit and finish matches perfectly in person. I‚Äôm not rich, but I‚Äôm happy to pay out for a handmade product that speaks to me. OP was very kind and helpful, and obviously put a lot of work into manufacturing these himself.¬†

Funny enough, today I saw a Benj Haisch video with this product, only to realize he was affiliated with AGS Supply (who likely saw the demand from OP‚Äôs update posts and decided to capitalize, offering a lower price due to their capabilities as an established company).

For those of you saying just tape it, this product isn‚Äôt for you. Yes, it‚Äôs pure vanity, but there is a demand for a niche product like this. People buy Leica for the build quality and aesthetics, we all know the body makes a near-zero impact on the final image. Given that, it‚Äôs not far-fetched for there to be a market for a such a product that aligns with the natural design language of these cameras we love.

lrn3zpo,These-Ad458,"I‚Äôm trying to remember the last time I met a person who actually knew what a Leica even is, without being at least somewhat into photography. 

Trust me, you better tape over that Nikon sign on your DSLR, that one has a lot higher chance of being stolen, than your Leica. Most of the people who know what a Leica is, have one themselves and are unlikely to steal yours. 

Seriously, this is hilarious beyond belief. It reminds me of a instagram video with a girl walking around with her Hermes Birkin bag and everyone in the street starring at her. Considering the fact that I don‚Äôt live in NYC, Paris or Milan, I‚Äôm pretty sure that if I go and ask 100 random people on the street what a Birkin is, 95 of them will have no idea, and maybe one of them would be able to recognize on the street. And about 90 of them won‚Äôt know what a Leica is. And of those 10, 9 of them will know about Leica, because they had a Huawei phone or they currently have a Xiaomi phone.

Edit: if anything, someone might steal it because it looks more like the X100VI - which, again, 99 percent of people don‚Äôt know about, but at least they might see it in more stores than Leica and ‚Äúrecognize it‚Äù because of that.",1,1728775763.0,2024-10-12 23:29:23,,0,1g1g0eg

lrgrav3,Wise_Top5709,"Instructions: 

1. Carefully remove the existing red dot. Use a small soft stick (like a matchstick) to press on the raised Leica lettering from both sides to loosen it. If needed, use mild heat from a hairdryer to soften the adhesive, but it can work without heat.
	
2. Once the adhesive is loosened, lift an edge of the dot to remove it. Use something thin like the tip of an X-acto knife if necessary. 

3. Place the removed dot on something like parchment paper Keep it in a safely stored or back in pouch. 

4. Wipe off any adhesive residue from the camera before applying the new dot.

5. Three double sided adhesives sided are provided per dot. Peel and position the replacement dot. Adjust it as needed, then press gently to secure it.",-5,1728677543.0,2024-10-11 20:12:23,,0,1g1g0eg

Cars are a problem, though. I dislike the poor software and crappy hardware in them, the SoC running the operating system is typically so cheap and weak that I don't see how it's justified in a car worth tens of thousands of euros/dollars whatever.

I just think that software issues feel out-of-place in a camera, and a premium product with premim price tag should, on average, have less of them.

I guess it depends on the use and product, but my desktop PC has been problem free practically for years on windows 10 (not a proof that a PC generally would be a hassle free experience).

lrw731q,iskosalminen,">I just think that software issues feel out-of-place in a camera, and a premium product with premim price tag should, on average, have less of them.

Modern cameras are computers as well. And more features they have, the more complicated and hence issue prone they are.

>I think the biggest issue I have with Leica is the time it takes for something like Q3 to turn on. My 10 years old DSLR wakes up instantaneously, that kinda sets the expectations for me.

You highlighted multiple issues in these few lines. First, Leica is not a software house. Startup times can reflect poor software optimization which happens to even more software focused manufactures.

Second, the startup time could reflect poor hardware optimization. If you think about the chips running in the latest iPhones or high-end Android phones, the ones in cameras are lightyears behind. This would require a whole essay to explain but there's things here like global availability, prices, skill gap, and so on.

And third, it could be an issue with software + hardware optimization.

Now for those expectations: think about how much less sophisticated your 10 yo DSLR is compared to Q3. The more sophistication you add, the less the non-software focused houses can compete with the giants in the room. Pick up a M2 and there's basically zero start-up time.

To put all this into context: if Apple would spin off their department which produces just AirPods, as a company, it would be over 25 times larger than Leica based on revenue ($485 million vs $12.1 billion). And that's just their AirPods department. And now think how simple (in theory) AirPods are and how often they still have software issues.

While we like to think Leica is up there, shoulder to shoulder with other big name companies, in reality, they're not even shoulder to shoulder with most of the other camera makers. For example Fujifilm's camera department had $3.34 billion in revenue and as a whole, $18.6 billion. That's over 7 times of Leica's.

Basically, what I'm saying is, this is frigging hard and even the big players are having to fix software issues. As long as we have software, we're going to see software issues.",1,1728921925.0,2024-10-14 16:05:25,,0,1g190xo
lrwjdtk,Correct_Ad_7397,"Nice comparisons, yes, but Leica only deals with one kind of SoC at one time. The same chip is inside the M and Q and SL series cameras. They all behave similarly, so they can span the development across all models without having to do it separately for each (at least for the most part).

Besides, I think fujifilm has a lot wider product portfolio than Leica does for its cameras, and probably the revenue reflects that as well. However, this also means that fuji needs to spread its development resources across different products, making the R&D and manufacturing / logistics way more complicated.

I don't think Leica is up there in terms of revenue, but if they are up there in terms of pricing then they need to deliver, sorry. The brand name alone doesn't add enough value to make the product match the price tag. With high price comes high expectations regardless of the size of the manufacturer.

I'd like to know how exactly is the old DSLR less sophisticated than a Q3. I don't think Leica cameras are particularly sophisticated in terms of the electronics and digital technology.

I don't really care about the company that much, but is Leica optics and microscopes etc. imaging equipment under the same camera brand revenue mentioned here? I guess that eats away at their budget too a bit. I suppose the microsystems is an ""independent"" company? In return, they get a lot of research that is applicable to cameras too, though.",1,1728925828.0,2024-10-14 17:10:28,,0,1g190xo
lrdv4zg,phdezra,"Good article. Thank you u/geryvoz  .I agree and think that while smartphones have largely replaced entry-level cameras for casual use, there's still a strong market for high-quality dedicated cameras (see: Rolex vs Apple Watch as an analogy) among photography enthusiasts and professionals. This trend is clearly driven by a desire for superior image quality, the prestige associated with luxury camera brands (Leica Q3 43 anyone!?), and a renewed interest in traditional photography as an art form.

lro45op,TheSwordDusk,"A random extremely beneficial thing you can do when making any art is to occasionally squint at your work so that your eyes lose focus. When you do this, your image (or painting or whatever) turns into blobs of tone. Making good art is often about simplification. When you squint and you see the dark areas all become one unified form, and your light areas become one unified form, it can be easier to determine things like: balance, contrast, shape, form, and your relative area of interest.

When I squint at the stage shot, the dudes lower legs seem like the point of importance. When I squint at the car, the shape of the highlight of the body seems like the area of importance. When I squint at the sitting guy, the bright sky and buildings jump out (not as good). When i squint at the second Porsche, the triangle ground (not so good) but also the headlights (very good) jump out.¬†

lrciser,phdezra,"If I am reading this correctly, sounds like you're encountering, more generally a semi-common issue to some: older lenses on modern camera bodies. Something to think about:

Focus Calibration: Different bodies may have slightly varying calibration for the rangefinder system, especially when using older lenses. It‚Äôs not uncommon for vintage lenses to have slight discrepancies in focus, particularly with (you guessed it) digital bodies like the M11.

Rangefinder Alignment: The fact that your lens aligns perfectly with the M6 but not with the M11 suggests that the M11's rangefinder may be calibrated differently. It might be worth checking if the M11 has any adjustments available or if it needs servicing?

Infinity Focus: For lenses, especially older ones,  check if they reach true infinity focus. If the focus doesn‚Äôt align at infinity, needs calibration.

Testing on Film: Since you‚Äôre currently shooting a roll on the M6, keep an eye on the results. Film can sometimes give a clearer picture of focus issues compared to digital, especially when pixel peeping. (Eeks)

Other users on here and other forums have faced similar issues. It may help to search for threads about older lenses on the M11. Once you develop your roll, you‚Äôll have a better idea of whether the lens needs adjustment. Good luck, and I hope it works out! Show us the photos. üòÅ

lrcstw5,redisburning,"likely calibrated to be spot on at f2.8. the 8 element's plane of best focus moves *dramatically* (and changes shape) as you stop down. in the case of most lenses, including the 8E, it moves backwards quite a lot. fwiw this is why the lens renders the way it does.

as long as you can reach infinity, I wouldn't worry about it. youre going to have to manually compensate for the lens anyway; otherwise the lens will be effectively useless at f4-5.6 on closer subjects. this was another thing that was lessof an issue on film, for a variety of reasons. if you dont want to deal with that, you'll need an FLE or APO summicron.

The lens mechanisms don‚Äôt really drift too much, especially these smaller simpler designs.

Test focus on your M11 with a lens that is known to be well calibrated.

FYI the 8e is often calibrated to front focus slightly to compensate for focus shift. Mine is like that. But the front focus should be very slight. What I focus on is still acceptably sharp, it is just on the fringe of the depth of field.",1,1728624409.0,2024-10-11 05:26:49,,0,1g0yeu5

lrfy1l0,Ragnar-177,"I faced this question some months back, I ended up happening upon a lightly used M11M for much the same price as a mint M10M was going for.

The M10 was my main camera and perhaps the M10M would have been an obvious choice, but despite the different shutter action and the less dense feel because of the Aluminium top plate, the M11M is a wonderful camera.

I shoot the Q2M and a Summilux 24 on the M11M. A much better match than the Summilux-M 28, in terms FOV and rendering to the Q2M.

I get where you‚Äôre coming from, I enjoy the care free AF photography the Q2M offers, in many ways a perfect camera if you can live with the fixed perspective the 28 offers. But for me, the more soulful photography happens with the M. 

I think the M10R is the quintessential M in terms of heft and tactile feedback. The M10M is exactly the same and images I‚Äôve seen from it at high ISO have an organic grain that‚Äôs hard to replicate on the M11M. Both perform equally well, however the battery life, EVF 2, higher ISO and electronic shutter add some significant improvements, nice to have ‚Ä¶ but not really necessary.

Price vs. Features (M10M at 50% of the price, you're getting a high-quality camera. Think about how much the features of the M11M matter to your photography style?; M11M newer technology often brings improved performance, better low-light capabilities, and enhanced connectivity options.)

Build Quality and Usability: Both models have excellent build quality, but the ergonomics and feel in hand might differ. If possible, try them out before deciding.

Future Proofing: The M11M will likely receive firmware updates and support for longer. If you plan to keep the camera for years, this might be a factor.

lrduan2,phdezra,"Short answer: 90mm.

Current Kit Evaluation: R6.2 and R7, you already have a solid setup. The 35-70mm and 50mm Summicron cover a nice range, but think about what you feel is lacking in your current kit.I would say the 90mm (sweet glass).

Versatility: If you often find yourself needing wider angles for landscapes or architecture, a 24mm or 21mm could be beneficial. Conversely, if you're drawn to portraits, the 90mm could be a great addition. What are you looking to get out of the lens? Also think about future proofing.

Also, take various shots at different shutter speeds, if they are consistently over/underexposed then potential issue re shutter.

lr6460f,RdkL-J,"I would sell the SL and the Q2, and keep the Q3 as your sole AF system, since you only have one SL lens, and it's a 50, close enough from the Q3 43. Losing the AF on the 28mm focal of the Q2 is not a big deal, your M 24mm on your M11 is great and it's a lot easier to zone focus at that focal. Unless you'd like to invest more in the SL ecosystem?

Keep the M7 for film if you still shoot film.

How do you feel about the M11 + M11M overlap? I get the attract of having both, but how much do you switch from one another? Converting an image in BnW is easy, and the extra ISO performance of the monochrome sensor isn't that big in this day and age.

With this potential scale down, I would fund a longer lens, likely a M 75 or 90mm. I would check Leica glass of course, but Voigtl√§nder has some real bangers in those focal too.",52,1728515508.0,2024-10-09 23:11:48,,0,1g047ip

lr868ty,UselessAsUsual,"Been there. Looks awfully familiar. 

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôd go from here:

Keep:
- M11 & M11M (but don‚Äôt update the mono next time around)
- Q3-43

Sell:
Q2 - Shooting anything below 35 (Q2 etc) for me is a pretty intentional choice. So you are well covered with the M kit there. also you have a Q3-43. 


SL2 & SL50 (if that‚Äôs the only SL lens - it competes directly with the Apo50m and in some ways with the Q43 while being bigger, heavier and slower in AF. 

The SL2 currently doesn‚Äôt bring you any money so you could keep it around as body only with an M adapter to shoot your nocti.
You also could change the SL50 for a 90-280 as this is the only focal range you can‚Äôt really cover with your kit, and shoot all other lenses with an m adapter.

That said the AF is and remains bad for fast moving subjects and moving more Glass across more distance in the 280 doesn‚Äôt make it better. I personally would sell it instead of investing more. 

M7 - not the most loved and analog comes with all its drawbacks. If you are still desperate to occasionally shoot film I‚Äôd rather get a cheap leicaflex SL with an R50 or just a minilux and put the M7 money somewhere else. 



Add/ Modify:
you‚Äôve got the run & gun covered with the Q3-43, so you can look into adding and modifying your collection with some special pieces on the M. they also keep their value and tap into that more intentional M experience. 

If you want, add/ replace for the incredible Apo35-M and a WATE Tri-Elmar. But you don‚Äôt need them unless you like their performance & versatility, as you already have a great 35 and 24.

I‚Äôd prefer the 75 Nocti to the 50 0,95 for its cleaner rendering, lower color fringing and nicer flare behavior. if you can find one used without backfocus, that‚Äôs also a gem. New is quite hard to obtain and pricey. 

I also prefer the lux-50 over the apo-50. the latter should only be used to shoot grumpy, weathered Greek fishermen, but never anyone you love as they will not love you anymore once they see their skin and extreme sharpness of their portrait shot with an apo50.

All of these are personal choices based on lens performance and personal taste. 

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôd do. And partially have done with a similar setup.",5,1728552243.0,2024-10-10 09:24:03,,0,1g047ip

lralmm7,bromine-14,"When buying an M5 look for a late serial number. If you Google m5 recommended serial numbers you will find recommendations from Sherry Krautter the Leica repair tech. Those are often 3 lug versions, which imo you want. The 2 lug is annoying, cumbersome, and hard to get used to if you switch out bodies often. You will notice 2 lugs often have the same dent where the third lug would be on the right side of the camera, they always get knocked there lol. Also look out for corrosion in the battery compartment. And make sure the rangefinder patch is clean and clear. Those are the two most important things aside from checking the shutter speeds and everything else works ok. The other thing you might not know immediately while testing out the camera is if the battery has an inconsistent contact. I think that this is a common problem with the M5 and it's the main reason I sent mine to DAG. There's a good chance you will have to send the M5 to get CLA when you get it.

Both Canon P and Leica M5 are rangefinders and can take M39 lenses, but the M5 has a built in TTL light meter (I don't think the P does), the M5 is more robust (and heavier) than the P, better VF on M5 (esp in low light). I think the more modern M lenses do not work without an adapter for the P. 

Both are good cameras, but the M5 gets the edge in many categories, IMHO. YMMV.

lra7bez,Everyday_Pen_freak,"From a value standpoint of today's standard, nothing in Leica's range would make any sense, in other words, people are not exactly buying Leica from a feature to price proposition. If value is what you're looking for, stick with the mainstreams that are Sony, Canon and Nikon (ZF is a great value camera btw). Below are my observation with a mix of personal experience, if you feel like reading through my rambling:

IMO, Q series is essentially a more original, somewhat German and more capable version of the D-Lux line (Basically rebranded Panasonic P&S), that has some elements of the M, the shutter dial on top, the no-grip design, and the manual focus experience that is close to a mechanical lens, meanwhile provides ease of use to people who are less inclined to manual control. For people who feel like digging deeper into both their bank account and Leica, this becomes a gateway to getting an M. 

The M series (Specifically for digital counterpart in this case) is meant to represent a legacy with some digital perks (Saving the cost of films, for example). It has less feature than a Q, yes, but everything that an M offers is all you will ever need with an M:

You don't need AF, because back when M are the workhorse, AF wasn't even a thing;

You don't need EVF, because back then people used OVF, which is arguably better in the modern world with so many screens around us;

You don't need video (Hence no more video function after M240), because video camera back in the day are completely different beasts...etc

All you do need are just the essentials, shutter speed, aperture, ISO and focus. No backing up to letting the camera do all the work for you, just simply photography with you yourself as the limitation.

So whether you should jump to the M or not depends on what you're really looking for. If you just want the look, Fujifilm X100 series are great alternatives with OVF (Not true rangefinder, but close enough). If you want performance...Sony...as soulless as they are, they are indeed great performers. If you want to reduce all the ""noise"" (fancy camera features), just cutting down to the essentials of photography, and if you value craftsmanship and keep the factory workers paid well for doing fine works (not many makers does that these days), Leica M is a great way to do it.",13,1728581843.0,2024-10-10 17:37:23,,0,1g0maup

lr9te0e,paigezpp,"Simple answer the optical rangefinder is really expensive.

More detailed answer. There are not many other brands if any that make rangefinder cameras today. So it‚Äôs a very specialized part that costs a lot because there are almost no economies of scale when compared with autofocus, electronic view finder etc.

Add to that the Q is mostly made by Panasonic and it only needs to be tuned for 1 lens per body.

The M stuff is done in-house and requires a decidedly old-world level of precision in manufacturing and assembly.",6,1728577308.0,2024-10-10 16:21:48,,0,1g0maup
lra4n59,IntrepidTraveller6,"The Q as a product in the Leica lineup has it's purpose. There is a reason it is seen as a gateway drug into the system. It offers a good balance between autofocus performance and manual focus. It also packs what is often seen as Leica's highest quality optics, for a more value driven price (in Leica terms). Buying the M mount version of this lens will cost more than any of the Q's a full retail price.

Is Leica losing money on Q's. I highly doubt it. But I would expect the margins on any of the Q models to be much tighter than other camera's and lenses they make. 

Just remember that Leica's prices are mostly driven by a few factors. First branding... that is unavoidable. Second scarcity.. they only make small batches. Third high quality and hand assembled hardware. \*not in this particular order\*",3,1728580987.0,2024-10-10 17:23:07,,0,1g0maup

lra8jzt,bwang29,"You will find the same thing in speakers. B&W Formation Duo for example, is around 50% cheaper than the same passive speaker with amps. It's really about a few things

- Upgrade cycles. People who use Qs tend to upgrade faster to Q2, Q3 etc.  
- Foot in the door: Q being contrainted to 28mm, 43mm, and no 35mm or 50mm is really interesting.  
- Status symbol: M is seen more of a photographer's camera, carrying a signal premium among leica and non leica owners

Ironically, I do believe the R&D cost of the Q and manufactoring cost of Q should be in fact higher than the M given the optics, firmware optimization for the optics. But M has super super high margin.

Cosina used to make rangefinder cameras and I think they made the Epson RD1 once said that they could not make a full frame range finder that can compete in price with Leica because it just costs that much to make.

lr58gag,AnonymousBromosapien,">Just noticed your comment about V5, which makes it a 1994 lens?

Yupp the V5 is the 1994-2013 production model. From what im understanding, after 2012 Leica serial numbering changed significantly and since then its been impossible to date a gear beyond 2012. 

What appears to be known is that 1) 6 bit coding started in 2006, and 2) in 2012 when the previous serial numbering system ended where Leica stopped going in order, the last known serial number that could be used to date a lens was about 42XXXXX.

Meaning any serial numbers on lenses greater than that means it is at least 2012 or newer. So with the V5 Summicrons being produced from 1994-2013, and the one ive got having a serial number that is 48XXXXX, that leads me to believe it is from the 2013 period for V5 Summicrons. So the last year.

Im not 100% certain though, and im sure there is someone who might know better!",3,1728504632.0,2024-10-09 20:10:32,,0,1fzzv4l

I also really really dislike carrying around lens hoods, so much so that I just never use them. So the extendable built in hood is a massive plus for me.

I also have a V2 Summicron, specifically the Dual Range one, that I really enjoy so I figured id stick with what I know.

These were indeed used in the early days of interchangeable lenses for the Leica, but by the time this camera and lens were made, they had fully transitioned from lenses that had to be matched to each body to a universal standard where every Leitz lens would work with every Leica body. So there was no longer any need for the plug on the back or the 'o' marking.

To use this lens with this camera, you would also need to buy a 35mm viewfinder, which fits in the accessory shoe. The included viewfinder is only for 50mm lenses.",3,1728597622.0,2024-10-10 22:00:22,,0,1g0mp82

As to your question, my $0.02 When evaluating a Leica camera set, when I see a bargain and GAS, I consider a few key points so I do not wind up with paperweights:

1. Mount Compatibility: The ""little 0"" you mentioned, I believe, refers to the Leica standard for lens mounts. If the camera doesn't have this marking, it may not be compatible with all Leica lenses. Have you asked if it supports the lens you are considering.

2. Price Evaluation: ‚Ç¨699 can be a fair price depending on the camera's condition, model, and included accessories. Get more photos and detailed description of body and lens.

3. Condition and Functionality: Always ask the seller for detailed information about any camera's condition. As noted above, request photos and, if possible, a demonstration of its functionality via video!

GL. Post some photos when you get it!

Today, a new Mid-Size car in the US sells on average for $32,000.
A new Leica M6 body is $5,995 or about 19% of the car.

1968: 1100 FF/mo  - So, the camera cost 62% of a month's wage.

2024: 2587 Euro/mo - So a modern M6 at 6000 Euro is about 2.3 months salary.

This is probably a more meaningful analysis because auto prices are all over the place but cost as a fraction/multiple of income is a pretty reasonable estimate.  So, by this measure, Leica's are going up in price in adjusted terms.

lr9lseb,phdezra,"Hmm, good question. Here are my thoughts as I do not have that adapter but have read about it. HTH:

Using the FotodioX M42 Pro Lens Adapter with Built-In Iris Control on your Leica M2 to shoot M42 lenses can be a great way to expand your lens options. Bear in mind though:

1. Focus Accuracy: The adapter is designed to maintain proper focus, including infinity focus, but some adapters can introduce slight variances, which might affect focus accuracy, especially at longer distances.

2. Iris Control: The built-in iris control is a useful feature from what I have read, allowing you to adjust the aperture directly from the adapter. This \*should\* simplify shooting, especially with manual lenses. 

3. Vignetting: Ugh. Depending on the specific M42 lens, you may experience some vignetting, particularly at wider apertures. This could be more pronounced with certain lenses. IDK.

4. Image Quality: Generally, adapters like this should not significantly degrade image quality from what I have read.

You shouldn't encounter \*major\* issues, testing the setup will help ensure everything works as expected; ensure you can get a refund otherwise? Enjoy experimenting with your new lens combination; post some photos!

lr50n69,ceih,"Zeiss lenses are made either in Germany by Zeiss or in Japan by Cosina. Most ZM fit lenses are made by Cosina. Generally speaking they are sharp, but with a ""clinical"" rendering.

Voigtlander used to be owned by Zeiss, and was then bought by Cosina. So the same factory is making both Voigtlander and Zeiss lenses, the difference is simply who *designs* the lenses.

So what are the actual differences?

* Voigtlander is usually cheapest option
* Voigtlander do make more ""interesting"" lenses that the others don't (eg: ultrawide 10mm, or a 40mm lens)
* Zeiss designs are externally a bit more modern, with focus nubs rather than knurled rings
* I'd argue Zeiss build quality is a bit better, but recent Voigtlanders have stepped up their game
* Zeiss lenses generally have ""better"" MTF charts
* Zeiss appear to be not really releasing new designs, whereas Voigtlander definitely do, with their modern APOs being really very good
* The generally accepted rule of thumb, which is not universally true, is that Voigtlander provides more ""classic"" rendering vs Zeiss' ""modern, high contrast, high sharpness"" appearance

The biggest difference is that the zeiss lenses is adjusted in third stops. Every other lens, including voigtlander, is adjusted in half stops. 

Both are extremely sharp and are very high performing. You should see if you can tell the difference when looking at samples. I suggest looking at flickr groups based on the respective lens. Most people have trouble distinguishing between the lens.  

The final difference is the hype. Voigtlander lenses are constantly hyped. There are more articles and more videos; especially comparing it to the Leica 50mm apo.

lr5at5d,phdezra,"I think¬†u/ceih nailed the crucial differences. I would add a few subtle ones:

1. Some photographers prefer the handling and ergonomics of one brand over the other, which can significantly impact how enjoyable it is to shoot with those lenses. Personally, I like Zeiss if given the choice you have.
2. Every lens has ""character"", so setting aside the MTF charts, consider the ""love"" of unique rendering. In this case: Voigtlander lenses for portraits and Zeiss for landscapes. IMHO. YMMV.
3. As a rule of thumb, I've always found Zeiss to be heavier and Voigtlander lighter--which may or may not be an issue; moreso for street photog work.
4. Price-to-Performance. IMHO, Zeiss wins. But, I am partial to Zeiss (as you can tell). Your call.
5. Zeiss is more ""well known"" commonplace (relatively speaking) so you may find more support if needed.

Otherwise, see¬†u/ceih points. GL. Show us some photos when all is said and done!

For the price, its great value. Apart from the size of the Distagon, the image quality is immensely good. Even Leica lenses develop loose aperture rings and other problems.

lr77v25,OnePhotog,"My first lens was the Zeiss 50mm planar. It has stayed in my collection the longest. It has a particular rendering I really like when focusing on subjects within 2 meters. Some of my favourite images were taken on that lens. The falloff can look very etheral. I had it for over a decade.

Over that time, I've developed a (for a lack of a better word) fetish for the 50mm focal length. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/sd7mfj/i\_really\_like\_the\_50mm\_focal\_length/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/sd7mfj/i_really_like_the_50mm_focal_length/) 

These days, I have a hard time picking up the zeiss. Not because of its performance, but it is because of the third stop aperture. With everything else being half stop, I can look in the meter and rely on muscle memory to know how many clicks to get the right exposure without moving my eyeline back to the meter. I can focus on focusing and my subject. If I need to recheck the exposure meter, that becomes a distraction.

I never used the voigtlander APO. It is because I always felt it was too big and too long. I have used the Leica 50mm APO, but that gets on the very edge of being too big and cumbersome for my tastes. I can imagine how much I would hate using the voigtlander. These days, I prefer to run around with the Leica 50mm summarit. They can still be found used for a great deal because they are still considered as the underdog. They are really sharp.

Did you pull the trigger? 90/2.8 is a good combo, though a bit heavy (1+ lb), but I don't thin you can get lighter for 2.8 and 90mm in the older lenses.  I love the fact that it is an original 1960s. (Can have it 6-bit coded,I think, if you need that. Leica Miami can do it.)

Can you get some better images of internal, glass closeups and so on?  If all is well, I believe this lens will give you some good photos (plus the vintage factor is cool--a 60-year-old lens still reeling off great photos is always remarkable). If this lens could talk!

In a nutshell, if the top plate doesn't go back on perfectly you lose visibility of the meter and projected shutter speeds in the finder. The is a sliver of a mirror that is glued to a floating armature which is ultra finicky when the plate goes back on. It's been years now but if I recall correctly when reseating the top you need to start at the shoulder with the shutter release and press very firmly towards the finder side of the camera while setting that side into place.

lr3u1wt,phdezra,"Curious: what camera are you upgrading to?

To your question: Given the condition you described, here are some factors I would  consider when pricing it (YMMV):

1. Condition: Since you mentioned that all functions work well and there are only minor surface-level wear marks, that‚Äôs a positive selling point.  I find that people sometimes overlook stating the obvious positive points in some auctions or forums. Think positive (and write it).

2. Market Demand: I am sure you have researched  current listings for similar M2 cameras on platforms like eBay, Leica forums, or elsewhere. Prices can vary based on demand (obviously) and sometimes external forces play a role. For instance, I have noticed an uptick in certain Leica models on eBay since the Q3 43 has been introduced.  I do not think it is me overthinking it. I think people want to quietly unload a body they do not use before the rush to sell and ""upgrade"" to Q3 43 (latest shiny toy).  Of course, it is not apples-to-apples, whether film body to the digital, but always be aware of market demand, in general.

3. CLA Status: While it hasn't had a CLA (in case newbies are wondering: clean, lubricate, adjust (though I wonder what a newbie would be doing in the r/Leica forum!) in three years, the fact that it functions well is important. I believe cameras that have been recently serviced typically command higher prices. (Kind of like when you put new tires or new brake pads on your car: it is clearly in better condition; not to say there is anything wrong as-is, but new (whatever) or CLA can be positive.

4. Original Price: You paid ¬£1100, and I am sure you know  used cameras can depreciate (though with Leica and some others, the reverse happens. Anyone familiar with the Panasonic GM1 camera? ""Very old"" but still commands hefty prices for what it is!) .

- Typical Selling Price: Based on the current market, a fair price for a Leica M2 in good working condition without a lens usually ranges from ¬£800 to ¬£950 BASED on my eyeballing the marketplace. YMMV and I hope you get as much as possible!

- Pricing Strategy: If you want to sell quickly, think the lower end of that range. If you‚Äôre willing to wait for the right buyer, you might start at around ¬£950 and see if you get interest. And then there is the strategy of starting at ¬£1 and let market economics bid up to the right point. Sometimes it creates an odd ""frenzy"" and with a great (not just good but great) description and photos, you can add +10% to final price. People want to consider the camera as if they have it in hand, so think that way when showing photos and write-up.

SO: A listing price between ¬£800 and ¬£950 would be reasonable, given its condition and the lack of a CLA. Of course, you should be open to negotiation, but only you know your bottom limit;  highlight the camera‚Äôs functionality and condition to attract potential buyers (there is almost always a market for Leica Mx cameras!). Good luck with your sale and your upgrade! Keep us posted. üôå

lr3nkri,HorkusSnorkus,"Well .... speaking as someone who owns an M2, M4, and an M5, I wouldn't be too hasty on this.

* Any M body built up to and including the M5 were hand fit and all brass.  After the M5, the construction quality and materials declined (slightly).  That's not to say an M6 or M7 are not fine cameras, they're just not the bullet-proof tanks the early Ms are.

* Getting parts for the M6 metering system is problematic.   Dunno about the M7.

* Early M7s had a variety of problems which were fixed in later production runs.

* If all you want is a convenient meter, there are all manner of flash shoe mounted meters that should be every bit as good as an internal M6 or M7 meter.

Your M2 is very clean.  I'd consider hanging on to (and not taking a loss) and putting a hundred quid into a decent flash mount meter.",1,1728486433.0,2024-10-09 15:07:13,,0,1fzqvz0

I know the quality dips ever so slightly. I've handled an m6 and was still happy with the quality, the trade off is worth it for me.

Soon you are able to replace the non ttl m6 light meter, a spare circuit board is currently in its testing phase at ACR. 
The M7 is still supported by Leica for repair, including meters. 

I've seen lots about some of the M7 issues but a lot of it is easy to check or remedy. As I mentioned before too, Leica will repair them.

And as for meters on top of a camera; unpopular opinion but i cannot stand them. Not only do they ruin the aesthetic of a rangefinder (making it more into an slr shape, irony), they are no quicker to use than the external Sekonic I have (at least in my experience). For the photography I do it's too many moving parts and takes too long. The shot moves on.

One correction to what I wrote - I believe the current MP went back to all brass as opposed to the zinc used in the original M6.

The screwmount Leicas work a bit differently to modern cameras in some ways. Third party instructions can be helpful, but are not always accurate - there are quite a few YouTube videos on loading these cameras that get it a bit wrong, and it's important to do this properly to avoid misloads and chipped film fragments than can get into the mechanism. Just follow the clear instructions in the manual, and be sure to trim the film leader to the profile shown on p29-30, which has a longer thin section than is standard today (you need to leave about 23 sprocket holes 'unpaired'). You can do this with scissors, taking care to cut between and not across sprocket holes so that none are damaged, and round off the corner. Or you can use a cutting template like the (expensive!) vintage ABLON, or one of the modern plastic versions sold on ebay to guide a sharp knife.

I don't think most new camera owners bother with the manual anyway; perhaps for some functions that they do not know, but certainly in a digital age people seem to be able to figure out most cameras and/or consult YouTube anyway bc ""experts"" or hobbyists post tutorials and color science recipes and so on anyway.

Ilford had a run of cassettes with poor baffle seals that they have acknowledged which went out earlier this year. Some of those are still going to be out in the wild and even still for sale. You are likely to see leaks that present just like this at either the very beginning for the very end of the rolls depending on storage conditions of that roll or even lighting conditions when the cassette was pulled from the camera. If you are willing to go through a process may even replace your faulty rolls for you. In my case, I provided photos of the negatives as well as their scans and information from the film cassette. They happily provided me replacement film. This does not align with any traditional Leica m light leak.

lr42m14,phdezra,"Here‚Äôs what I'd consider regarding its performance on your M10-R (YMMV!):

SC Version

1. Single Coating: The SC version typically has less anti-reflective coating compared to the multi-coated (MC) version (IMHO). This can result in:

   - Flare: More susceptibility to lens flare, especially in high-contrast lighting or when shooting into the light. (At least be aware of this so you can avoid.)

   - Contrast: Potentially lower contrast and more pronounced flare effects can lead to a softer, more vintage look, which some may find appealing.

   - Color Rendering: The color rendition might be warmer or less saturated than the MC version, YMMV.



Performance on Digital

- Digital Sensors: Digital sensors are more sensitive to flare and ghosting than film (I remember my Minolta XG-1 days!), so you may notice these effects more prominently with the SC version on your M10-R.

- Dynamic Range: The M10-R has excellent dynamic range, woo hoo, which can help mitigate some of the issues associated with the SC lens. You'll have more flexibility in post-processing to enhance contrast and color. Lightroom?



Comparison with the MC Version

- Sharpness and Contrast: The MC version is \*generally\* sharper and offers better contrast due to its multi-coating. If you prefer a more modern, clinical look, the MC version might be better suited for digital photography.

- Character: The SC version may provide more ""character,"" with a softer rendering that can be aesthetically pleasing for certain types of images, particularly portraits or street photography.

Recommendations?

1. Experiment: Don‚Äôt hesitate to experiment with your SC lens. Take it out in various lighting conditions to see how it performs. You may find that it excels in certain scenarios, especially in softer light.

2. Post-Processing: Be prepared to adjust your images in post-processing. Increasing contrast, managing highlights, and adjusting colors can help you achieve the look you desire. Depends on the image captured to begin with but a lot can be done depending on how much time you want to spend.

3. Know Your Style: Since you mentioned you appreciate character but are wary of excessive haze, pay attention to your results and see how the lens performs in terms of sharpness and rendering. 

While the SC version may not perform as cleanly as the MC version on a digital body, it can still yield beautiful results, especially if you enjoy a more vintage aesthetic. Embrace the character of the lens, and with some experimentation, you may find it to be a valuable addition to your kit! Enjoy your photography journey with the Nokton!

lr0ld8n,mrjosh72,"I have an M10M and M10-R‚Äîso not quite an M11. But I've been thinking a lot about the differences between color and mono sensors and workflows. My own observation is that no one but me‚Äîand other online Leica obsessives‚Äîseems to be able to tell the difference between the files I, personally, get from the two cameras. I'm not saying there's no difference, because there is. But it's much more visible during the editing process than it is to viewers.

This is partly because I think the M10-R noise feels quite natural in black and white‚Äîso low light conversions look really good, despite some noise at high ISO. And it's also because I mainly take pictures of people. When I make landscape photographs with the M10M, the range of tonality is more noticeable and useful. But for portraits and candid documentary photography, the differences are less visible. (And less consequential.)

So, I am gearing up, mentally, to sell the M10M. I've owned it for a year, and I' going to give it another 3-6 months, during which I'm going to shoot the M10M more and more, especially during daylight and outdoors, when I think the sensor delivers the most. It's a special camera and I want to make sure that I'm not going to regret selling it. But I'm strongly suspecting that I'll sell the camera. I'm not seeing anything else in the Leica lineup right now that really appeals to me, so I'll probably just pocket the cash. Although there's always the Q3 43.....

All of which is to say, I think selling both of your cameras for an M11-P is a totally reasonable idea, and if you think it makes sense for you, don't let random people on the internet convince you that the M10M is the Ultimate Camera for the Pure Leica Experience‚Ñ¢.

And then we'll see what happens with the M12. I honestly wish the M10P came back into production with an M11 battery. M10 series is peak digital M.

lr2lkrd,Wedoh,"Hey man i have been in a very similar situation many times.  
  
I have been researching why that is for a while and would like to share some thoughts for consideration.  
  
The thing is these days we are bombarded by information. Ask yourself do you ""need"" the M11-P? Or do you ""want"" it? And ask yourself why. Chances are that you saw some YouTube videos, read comments on Reddits, saw a review.

What happens is, we start building up a desire, we feel it in the gut. Suddenly we are burden by a choice that we feel we have to make, this is where our rational brain comes in. It wants to help us out by comparing specifications and rationalize things, deciding by logic. And actually the rational brain is not that good at actually making choices... Thats usually what our gut is good at.

These kind of decisions are complex, actually our unconsciousness is quite good at handling complex problem solving (UTT theory), but it is subject to all kinds of biases, therefore it needs our rational brain to help us out.

Eventually after a while the sensation of the new thing is gone and it feels more like agony to not land in a conclusion, we eventually make a choice but after a while it might not feel right, or we read another post about how the X100VI is sooo good for something we did not think about. And we regret selling it.

My point is when you stop taking in to much viewpoints and opinions about gear by avoiding social media, reviews, forums etc suddenly we start to look at what we already have and use it. And when you do you find out what works and what doesn't.  
  
Because thats the thing with needs and wants, marketing is used to build up a desire and reviews and social media could be seen as a kind of marketing strategy. But what kinds of needs does buying the M11-P meet for you? The answers to that wont come from reviews or this thread, the reviewers does the review from their perspective, their own needs. To find out your needs you have to seek answers from your self, by using what you have. And that takes a lot of time and effort.

What happens is its a lot more convenient to find answers on YouTube, it could be seen as the path of least resistance but actually in the long term, finding your own needs is a valuable investment. And it probably brings more joy.

By using what you already own you find what you like and don't, we do it all the time as photographers. We all have goals that we want to achieve and our needs are like requirements that needs to be meet for us to reach them.

Therefore I would recommend that you use what you have and look into yourself to find insights about your needs and goals, motivations and pain points, both functional needs like physical layout of buttons or OVF vs EVF and emotional needs, like if you are a minimalist and want to own only one camera.

Sure others perspectives helps as inspiration, we need that too but these days we get to much and its so much easier to browse YouTube for answers.

Hope that helps!",4,1728470679.0,2024-10-09 10:44:39,,0,1fzc1wm

lr3e8e2,phdezra,"Hmmm, I believe the crux of the matter here is Dual Native ISO.

Dual native ISO means the camera has two ISO settings that provide optimal performance and minimal noise. For many cameras, this typically includes a lower ISO (eg 400) and a higher ISO (eg 3200). AND Performance at the higher native ISO =  the sensor is optimized to handle low light with better noise control and dynamic range.

So, what can we learn here (IMHO!):

1. Improved Image Quality at 3200 ISO: This is likely because the camera is utilizing its second native ISO setting. In this mode, the sensor is designed to perform better, reducing noise significantly in low-light conditions.
2. Dynamic Range Expansion: The expansion in dynamic range (the IRE levels you mentioned) could be due to the way the camera processes the image at this higher sensitivity. The sensor may be able to capture more detail in both highlights and shadows when operating at its optimal native ISO.
3. Noise Characteristics: Noise can behave differently at various ISO settings (as I am sure you know--basic photog stuff). At higher native ISOs, the noise may be less perceptible or more uniform, leading to a cleaner appearance in shadows.

So, no, you‚Äôre not crazy or dumb; you‚Äôve observed a significant aspect of how dual native ISO systems work. (I have spoken with videographers and photographers who note similar improvements in image quality when utilizing the higher native ISO settings, especially in low-light scenarios.) It‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre experimenting and discovering these nuances! üôå

When you are first learning the camera, you struggle to distinguish what is user error and what is a problem with a camera. Your inexperience can make it difficult to diagnosis.

Someone who has been collecting cameras for a while might be able to make a better assessment. Even then, they often come across lemons.

When you go through a dealer, they will have gone through the trouble of making sure it is in working order. If there is a problem, you can walk into the store with your receipt (sometimes you won't need it because they'll recognize the camera already a mile away) and will look you in the eye before telling you when you'll be able to shoot again.

lqz97ca,ihavachiken,"Hey! I've got an M7 with the older style DX reader and I've never had an issue with it (over the past ~5 years). 

The original problem as I understood was that it requires metal on metal contact to read the DX sticker and sometimes the contacts could get dirty or otherwise not match correctly giving inaccurate DX readings. A simple wipe down would usually fix the problem unless the contacts were too worn (pretty rare afaik) and couldn't read the DX code any longer.
The optical upgrade resolved these problems by removing the need for physical contact.

Regarding manual override, there is zero problem doing so and the ""error"" you'll get is a flashing light in the viewfinder telling you what ISO the dx code is actually reading. If you see that, it simply means you've manually selected a different ISO. I use the camera in manual override 99.99% of the time and it's not at all a problem.

And outside of obvious cases, like shooting in a desert, most everyday use doesn't require a protective filter.

The primary reason to shoot with a Q camera is the outstanding image quality. And there's no reason to compromise it by adding another piece of glass to the equation. Use the cap and hood and common sense and you don't need to spend the extra $$$$.

lqvo20k,AnonymousBromosapien,"Yupp! EVF screen deamination is the big one outside of sensor dust. That actually part the reason *(from my underatanding)* why they dont replace original Q EVFs with the same, but instead replace them with Q2 EVFs. Basically when you look into the EVF if you notice an area of it that appears lighter or less contrasty than the rest... the EVF is deaminating. Mine has it, but honestly its really not noticable unless im shooting in a dark setting. Outside in the sun, cant even see where the issue is.

Other than that, just the dust issue really. But I will say, ive had mine since like 2016 and never had a dust issue and I live in the desert lol. All ive done to it was put some gaffers tape over the mic and speaker holes but idk if that does anything lol, just know I havent had a dust issue.

Not that they are expensive on the Q, but id make sure the batteries are original from Leica. I used to have just 1 original battery with mine and 1 wont get you through a whole day of shooting so I bought a handful of Panasonic batteries that are supposed to be the same thing basically... but they didnt work. Would literally get like 30 shots out of the Panasonic batteries before they were dead. From my understanding the Q was meant to recognize third party batteries and feign *""low battery""*, but others have said they worked fine for them. Anyways, used Q batteries can be found for like $30 a piece. Just as an FYI.

I dont think there is anything else to mention really. Its a great camera, ive had no real issues with mine other than the EVF deamination, but I havent been bothered by it enough to be compelled to send it off.",3,1728353900.0,2024-10-08 02:18:20,,0,1fyo677

lr3iufe,phdezra,"Here are the factors I would consider:

1. Leica M10 with 50mm Summicron f/2

Pros:

* Iconic Lens: The 50mm Summicron is renowned for its sharpness, contrast, and beautiful bokeh. It‚Äôs a classic choice for portraiture and general photography--but you know this already. üòÅ
* Build Quality: Leica lenses are built to last (you know this, too!), and the Summicron is no exception, offering exceptional performance and durability.
* Simplicity of Use: The M10 experience is now streamlined, allowing you to focus on composition and exposure.  Do not underestimate this.

Cons:

Lower Resolution: The M10 has a 24MP sensor, which may limit cropping flexibility and detail in large prints compared to the M10-R.  Hmmmm.



2. Leica M10-R with Voigtl√§nder Glass

Pros:

* Higher Resolution: The M10-R‚Äôs 40MP sensor captures more detail, allowing for larger prints and more cropping options.  DO you print often?
* Cost-Effective Lenses: Voigtl√§nder lenses are  more affordable than Leica glass while still providing good optical performance -- BUT it is not a Leica. üôÑ.
* Cons:
   * Lesser Resale Value: Voigtl√§nder lenses don‚Äôt hold their value as well as Leica lenses. And when you inevitably sell it. hmmm.
   * Variable Performance: While Voigtl√§nder lenses can be excellent, they may not match the optical quality of Leica glass (YMMV), especially at wider apertures.

SO:

Priorities: If image quality and resolution are your main priorities, the M10-R offers a significant advantage with its higher megapixel count. This is especially relevant if you plan to do large prints (see my question above) or crop images frequently.

Lens Quality: If you value having a high-quality lens that can deliver exceptional results, the 50mm Summicron is hard to beat. Full stop! It‚Äôs a lens that holds its value and is a staple in the Leica offerings.

Future Proofing: The M10-R may give you more flexibility moving forward, especially in terms of sensor technology and resolution. What are your long term realistic goals?

THEREFORE, if you prioritize image quality and resolution, go with the M10-R\* and invest in a good Voigtl√§nder lens. However, if you‚Äôre drawn to the unique character and performance of the 50mm Summicron and prefer a classic Leica experience, then the M10 is a fantastic choice, IMHO.

--> Whichever option you choose, you‚Äôll be investing in a remarkable system! üôå

lr202dy,vxxn,"I think it depends a lot on how the idea of third-party glass makes you feel. The actual results out of voigtlander lenses seem to be excellent, so I wouldn't hesitate on that basis if you have a utilitarian results-oriented approach to your photography. But for many people buying one of these cameras is an emotional experience and I knew that when I imagined my object of desire it always had a Leica lens on the front. The industrial design aesthetic is different, which does matter somewhat for the type of object that becomes part of your identity.

For myself, I've bought and sold enough gear that I wanted to approach this purchase without compromises, because you lose money every time you have to sell something to trade up toward what you actually wanted in the first place. So I actually bought my used 50 lux ASPH before I even had a body to go with it.

Depending on luck, condition, and your 50mm lens choice, that entire lens kit can be had for 1000-1600 all day long.

lqr5sda,GammaDeltaTheta,">I‚Äôm considering buying a Leica M2. This seemed to be pretty popular in the body is affordable compared to most other leica. I‚Äôm wondering what people feel between the M2 /M3 / M4 ?

As you are thinking about a 35mm lens, I would suggest the M2 (or M4) over the M3, because the M3 lacks 35mm framelines (though it has a great viewfinder for 50mm). The M2 lacks 135mm framelines, but that's a much less commonly used focal length. The M4 has both 35mm and 135mm framelines, and all of these cameras have 50mm and 90mm framelines, but none have 28mm or 75mm framelines - you need an M4-P or later for that. However, some people prefer the less cluttered finders of the earlier cameras, and for the classic combination of 35mm, 50mm and 90mm the M2 is the least cluttered of all - only one frame is shown at a time.

The M4 has the 'modern' style articulated wind-on lever and faster rewind crank that some of us prefer, but others don't (they reverted to the old style in the MP). It also has a faster loading system than either the M2 or M3. One disadvantage of the M2 over the other two is that the frame counter must be reset manually. M2 and M3 prices tend to be similar, but the M4 is generally somewhat more expensive.",2,1728294987.0,2024-10-07 09:56:27,,0,1fxwpmb

For 50mm, the same brands have good options along similar lines. 50/1.5 Voigtl√§nder Nokton and Zeiss C-Sonnar more for color. Light Lens Lab 50/2 Elcan and 50/2 Speed-Panchro more for B&W; their 50/1.2 Noctilux 1966 is on the pricey side.",1,1728279101.0,2024-10-07 05:31:41,,0,1fxwpmb
lqr20w7,Ready_Blueberry_6836,"I don't think you can go wrong with any of those cameras.  They are all four the classic film M cameras.   I would say try to find one in good condition and then you can be the one to give it battle scars.  

Lenses are also abundant.   The M mount lenses are usually small and nice.  I personally don't have a Voigtlander, but people love them.   I really am liking the Zeiss lens I have been using.  I would say I would get a C-Biogon 35 or the Planar 50mm if I was getting a first lens and had no money for a Leica.   Leica lenses are of course the highest quality, but you do have to pay for what you get with them.  They are super collectible though so you can usually sell them for the same price you bought them for.   One nice option to look at is the 40mm M-Rokkor or 40mm Summicron (the same lens).   It still is a very good deal.  You just wont have frame lines for it, but it is easy to estimate.",1,1728292342.0,2024-10-07 09:12:22,,0,1fxwpmb
lqrld4e,spektro123,"M2 is a great camera and you won‚Äôt be disappointed. 

M3 has a slightly better VF but it‚Äôs not that great with 35mm. Either you have to use whole VF and deal with the fact that 35mm lens is a bit wider and there‚Äôs no parallax correction or use external VF, which either suck or cost a lot. It‚Äôs mechanically just a bit smoother, but that doesn‚Äôt have any impact on photos.

M4 is M2 with faster rewind and (arguably useless) 135mm frame line. Leica realized this at some point and began making goggled 135mm lenses, that magnify 90mm frame line. M4-2 is even cheaper and IMO it is a better choice when you‚Äôre tight on the money. It‚Äôs black chrome M4 without a self timer. It has some bad fame, but it‚Äôs as reliable as any other M. I can‚Äôt feel any difference in mechanics quality between my M4-2 and M2.

lqq5ffv,armevans,"Absolutely this. The M2 is a fantastic camera, and while I do tend to prefer the M4, the M2 tends to be more affordable and offers broadly the same feature set, only with slightly less convenient film loading and rewinding.

The Voigtlander Color Skopar 35/2.5 is a great lens to start with as well. It‚Äôs fast enough to use in most circumstances and small enough to make the camera fit in a jacket pocket. It‚Äôs also plenty sharp and renders nicely. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything that outperforms it unless you spend about twice the price for a Zeiss C-Biogon. 

If you‚Äôd prefer to shoot 50mm (my preference), any of the Voigtlander 50s would be a fine starting point (the 50/1.5 Nokton is particularly good), or the Zeiss Planar.",6,1728272356.0,2024-10-07 03:39:16,,0,1fxwpmb

I actually now find the meter in the later leicas more confusing than convenient and my exposure hit rate is at least as good as it was when I shot with a metered body. There is something incredibly peaceful about shooting a meterless leica. It is just you and your composition. In terms of purchases, I would absolutely hold on for a properly CLA‚Äôed body and a lens in good condition. There‚Äôs nothing that undermines the experience of a new camera more than having to troubleshoot technical problems, wasting time, film and money. Get a camera you can trust in, even if it costs a little more. As for bodies, my favourite is the M4, but for some reason I use my M2 more at the moment. Go figure!

But I hope  your price is a lot less than $176! You can find more versatile and powerful flashes (usually in black) for much less money without the Leica badge. This one will have been made for them by another company, perhaps Metz at that time. The guide number of 20 at ISO 100 is rather low, the reflector is fixed to the angle of view of a 35mm lens, and there is no sync socket built in.

43mm is wide enough in my opinion for great landscape photos and if I need wider landscape, I will probably shoot multiple images and merge them on Lightroom. 

The only thing I will probably miss is interior shots, since the 28mm shines on that, however I‚Äôm most of the time shooting outside, so that allows me to move backwards a bit to have more of the scene, while keeping a great portrait lens.

lqmp3zu,AltruisticCover3005,"I had the same issue once, not with an M camera but with a goggled Summaron 35 originally made for the M3.

My M3 did not actually need it, because during a repair at Wetzlar the original 0.91 finder had been replaced with a 0.85 finder that had 35 mm frames. Still, that was the lens that I had and I used it on my M3 and M6 at the time. 

The rangefinders of both cameras were peferctly well aligned, but the lens had this shift in hight. It was really annoying. If there was a vertical line, you could easily focus on it, at infinity you saw that there was no side deviation. But one image was a few millimeters higher than the other so if you tried to focus on a e.g. a black point on a white wall, you had to bring them so that they were exactly above one another. And if you die not hold the camera perfectly leveled, you were off a bit.

It really was annoying and it could not be fixed, the right lens of the goggle over the small rangefinder window was missaligned with some signs of earlier repairs made by a cowboy (as my favorite, Nottingham based Nikon F2 technician would have said it).

  
Enough of the anecdotes, If the camera looks nice and came at a decent price, send it for CLA and be happy.",1,1728229219.0,2024-10-06 15:40:19,,0,1fwusoj

Do you want an electronic shutter or a mechanical shutter? I've heard enough stories about people going out to somewhere and their M7 has run out of batteries and they now have a brick that can only do 1/125. Managable, but not ideal.

The other thing is aperture prority, will you use it? Do you want it?

Last thing is flair, can you live with the occasional focus patch flair that the M6 has.

Me personally, I went for the M6 because I like the slightly lighterwieght build, size and feel. They're very close though.

Also, surprised that the M7 is cheaper than the M6, usually M6's are the cheaper ones.",3,1728140276.0,2024-10-05 14:57:56,,0,1fwrvgo
lqh9t92,Knowledgesomething,"M7 has an electronic shutter and the M6 has a mechanical shutter. If a battery dies on your M7 it could become a brick with only 1/125 S.S. available. M6 is fine without a battery, it's just the meter that dies. But the batteries last long, and you could carry a spare one if you're really paranoid. The battery's really small anyways.  
The M7 has aperture priority which I sometimes miss. The M6 does not have such fancy feature.  
The M7's shutter speed dial is bigger and easier to operate than that of a M6 which is pretty small and finicky (for me, anyways.)  
M6 is a bit smaller and shorter in height compared to the M7. You could prefer smaller cameras. I do.  
A old original M6 has a zinc top plate which might corrode in long terms. The M7 is brass.  
The logo design is different. I find my M6 sexier than the M7, especially with its titanium plating and ostrich leather.  
These small things can be quite big in terms of user experience so I think you should consider these.  
  
If you can't decide just go for the sexier one. But not the M4-P. Go safe and go with the one with the meter.",1,1728146626.0,2024-10-05 16:43:46,,0,1fwrvgo

- Fujifilm X-T2 and multiple lenses. I have not shot with this much lately, only couple of shots this year because Canon is more lightweight. This is still my most used camera all the time. Great camera, great lenses and awesome quality. Only negative side is the size and weight for being everyday carry.

- Canon Ixus 265 HS. This small point and shoot is when I want to take random photos to my old-school website and I want small sized photos (640x480). Handy for it, can select on camera small size and quality is good.

And stupid me considered that a bargain.

  
As a man who had previously owned M3, M2 and M6 I tell you that you chose the M5 for exactly the right reasons. the points mentioned by you  (needle meter, shutter indication, big shutter dial) are three of the four points why I say that the M5 is the best M for a shooter who does not want to own it simply to admire it. The fourth is the most imporatnat: The meter is not a center weighted average meter like in the M6 and MP but a very tight spot meter.

  
As far as I am concerned you should buy the classic meterless cameras (M3, M2, M4, M4-2 and M4-P) if you want to use sunny 16 or an external meter and you should buy an M5 if you want an internal meter. I prefer it to the M6 so much that I acutally would pick the M5 if both cameras came at the same price.

lqdz2cz,GammaDeltaTheta,"The CLE has its fans, but is completely dependent on electronics from 1980, which have something of a reputation for being rather flaky at this point and can't be repaired by most technicians. You also don't have framelines for the common 35mm and 50mm focal lengths - it's really a camera for fans of the 40mm lenses made for this camera and the earlier Leica CL, or 28mm lenses, for which it also has framelines. While it's one of the cheapest M-compatible rangefinders, it doesn't go for that much less than an M2 that will last forever (and exposure meters are cheap). The CL is quite a different camera with a mechanical shutter. Dead meters are quite common and the captive take-up spool can break. It lacks 28mm and 35mm framelines, but you do get the 50mm frame with this one. Both cameras have 40mm and 90mm framelines.

The M6 Classic is a very good choice, solid and reliable with a good meter and the classic Leica M form factor. Pretty much everything can be serviced currently except the meter circuit board, and it looks like there will soon be a third party replacement for that too, while Leica may get around to porting the 2022 meter to it eventually, as they have suggested they will do (for a price). The zinc top plate construction is tough, harder to dent than the brass used earlier (and today), but a minority of cameras suffer from 'bubbles' in the finish (corrosion probably due to plating defects). It's best to avoid these. Today's M6, the 2022 version, offers a brass top plate and a more flare-resistant finder as well as a fully-serviceable meter, but it's double the price of a nice Classic.",1,1728088662.0,2024-10-05 00:37:42,,0,1fw86s9

+1 stop overexposed is what you'd get by shooting at 200 ISO, +2 stops overexposed by shooting at 100 ISO, etc. Of course you don't really need to change the ISO setting, and I probably wouldn't bother within the same roll - e.g., instead of switching to 100 ISO, you can just open up the aperture by a couple of stops or reduce the shutter speed by a couple of notches from the metered setting manually. The film has enough latitude to get acceptable results with this level of overexposure (some people shoot Tri-X at 200 ISO routinely), but you may or may not prefer the effect.",3,1728122241.0,2024-10-05 09:57:21,,0,1fwjl30

Metering and the rating of film is something that people can get really in the weeds with. Typically you're pretty safe to overexpose a scene by a stop or three with minimal consequence.

If your 100% price jump estimate is correct, I‚Äôd go for the M240 in a heartbeat. They‚Äôre still excellent cameras capable of taking wonderful photographs, and the battery life is exceptional.

While I‚Äôve considered an external finder, no external finder will perfectly match the view of your lens, so there will be a little bit of sloppiness in your framing regardless.

I can also flip the screen up and shoot waist level like I used to do with my old hasselblad, with the resolution to back up the comparison, even square cropped.  If I want a literal automatic everything point and shoot, I have that too.  I may only have one focal length, but at least 90 percent of the photos i have ever taken have been shot with a focal length between 35mm and 50mm (35mm film equivalent), so the one lens is totally fine with me.  Another advantage of the q is that when i need critical composition, i don't have to think about focus shift or parallax correction, what I see is what I get.  I have access to shutter priority if I know I am going to be shooting fast moving subjects in variable lighting conditions.  Also, there's macro mode, which is appealing because sometimes I just like shooting examples of interesting textures as a sort of abstract thing.

I have always kept something around like a Sony body etc, but I hated using them. Thats where the Q3 43 comes in. I dont like big autofocus lenses and honestly I just need 1 good prime autofocus lens since I also use an M and prefer to invest money in those lenses instead. 

I don't care how good I am at zone focusing at f/11. I want consistent in focus pics of my kid wide open. I have shot many bday parties with an M and its just not easy taking in focus pics of a bunch of cracked out kids high on sugar, unless you're fine with every shot being stopped down by quite a bit. I also want to be able to hand the camera to my wife or friend and have them take pics. I also need a tilt screen to get low shots of the kid and I want to be able to shoot some decent quality video with a LOG profile for those really special occasions. 

These are all conveniences that add up. So for me instead of having a Sony/Canon body with a ton of lenses or to invest in a much larger SL system and have to constantly lug it around, I just have a single Q camera that I actually like enjoying and makes my life as a dad easier. Because it's a fixed lens camera also means I dont search for what auto focus lens I want next etc. It allows me to focus on my M for that.

For a brief stint pre-Fujifilm X100 I used a Voigt 40 EF mount on a 5D ii, and I remember liking it quite a bit. 

So I started setting my little Sony point and shoot to 43mm and going around shooting like that and discovered, I really like the FOV. I preordered the Q3 43 and it's awaiting me upon my return to the US... I think it would be an excellent pairing with the Q3, I might even use it more - but I might miss the interchangeability I had with my CL. So IDK. It still might go back.

lqsslym,TTsegTT,"\^\^\^ The way I finally disengaged from GAS a decade ago was to liquidate all but my Sony RX1 and Sony RX10 fixed lens cameras.  Between the two, they covered most all my hobby's photographic needs.  The tech is now a bit aged, limiting their ability to share immediately, but that is not a bad thing, usually.   

But after a decade, as I approach retirement, I thought it time to treat myself and explore advances in the fixed lens world.   Nothing really dazzled me over the last few weeks of searching until I came across the Q3 43, as it does not replace either of my existing fixed lens cameras, but definitely opens the door to being my go-to daily carry.   While the RX1 (35mm) has been my primary (as the RX10 is just too big to lug around without an intended destination), I still find myself cropping it much of the time.   And with 60MP Q3 vs 24MP RX1, it seems the Q3 43 is basically the long end compliment to the RX1, while I use the RX10 III for video and sports/action/wildlife photography. 

When I rotated out of GAS, I rotated into watch collecting and bought a Rolex GMT Black & Blue soon after it came out.  A decade later I even more appreciate my decision to justify part of the spend on quality/capability, but also part of the spend on brand cache.   A defining model from an iconic brand will always have allure, even well past the time it's tech is no longer relevant.   I don't think I'll be able to say the same with my Sonys'.

All have a circuit board.
You know what else does - my OM-4 from 1983 and she runs perfectly. 

Here is what I like about the M7. Yes aperture priority but also the shutter speed dial can be reached with the camera up to your eye. It‚Äôs larger than the M6 version. Also in aperture priority it will allow shutter speeds that otherwise can‚Äôt be selected. This is not often spoken about but is a big advantage. Just make sure you get one with the optical DX code reader. The physical contact version makes it really hard to load and specifically unload film.

lq88u04,Malicali,"As I say in every one of these threads. 

Due to EU manufacturing laws, Leica are required to maintain parts production for cameras for 10 years after their discontinuation. M7‚Äôs were discontinued in 2018, meaning Leica will maintain their capability to *PRODUCE* replacement parts for them until 2028. 

People espousing concern for M7 electronics largely comes from the boom in M6 popularity when M6‚Äôs were $1,800 and M7‚Äôs were over $3k. Now that M6‚Äôs and M7‚Äôs are so close in price, justifying the former is largely done with overblown concern for the electronics - ironically when the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù cameras are the ones becoming harder to repair due to lack of electronic parts. 

‚ÄúBut the M6 will still work when the electronics can‚Äôt be repaired‚Äù - I‚Äôd rather have an M2, M4 or M-A at that point. 

IMO OP - if your decision is between an M7 and M6, the only M6 that makes sense is a 2022 M6. And if you want that .85x finder, you know what your decision is üòå",5,1728002868.0,2024-10-04 00:47:48,,0,1fvm4oo

everyone mentions aperture priority, which is my preferred mode as well, but rarely mentioned are:

M7 is much more usable and user friendly than M6. For all obvious reasons. When it breaks, malfunctions, fails etc. it can be dealt with, or not,  but you'd have several years or decades of enjoyment.

Anyway, the way it works is that if you use 3rd party lenses, you have to manually tell the camera which lens (or at least a lens that is a close as possible to an existing Leica lens) you are using, otherwise it will stick to the last used lens.

For me personally it is my OCD that I want to know what lens I took a photo with, so I painted black & white dots (according to the table I linked above) on my Voigl√§nder lenses to make them switch automatically. In e second step I use a plugin to change the EXIF data to the correct lens name. But that is just for statistics, not that I would care for corrections.

Maybe manually setting the camera to whatever lens you are using is OK for you, I know that I forget to do that every single time, hence painting the dots on my lenses.",1,1728297550.0,2024-10-07 10:39:10,,0,1fvtk4x

At the moment I am thinking that I want to take my: M10 Monochrom and SL2 with (at minimum) a 24mm Elmarit-M, a 35mm Summicron-M, and a 50mm Light Lens Lab or Summilux-M. If space allows, I may take a 90mm Summarit-M or a 135mm Tele-Elmar-M. For the SL2, I would probably also take my 24-70. That alone is a nice travel setup, but I never want to leave home without my Q3, which is a third camera. 

So the above is what I would like to have for any situation and is probably what I will take (minus a lens or two). The nonsensical side of me wants to take my Fuji GFX50SII with a 55mm lens and potentially a Fuji X100VI, if anything just to compare it to the Q3 for travel. 5 cameras?

Not a terrible deal.

Keep in mind that this certainly will not be the final price, at least not in the long run; the camera will probably need a CLA so calclate another 300-500 EUR for the repair shop based upon what they find to be defective.

The M10 is a superb camera but I wouldn‚Äôt go back. You need lenses but I didn‚Äôt. I would suggest you buy an M10 and whatever optics you can afford right now and you will be very happy.

The wide aperture on a semi-wide lens has a distinctive look that I quite like. You get the wider context from 28mm but the subject isolation from the f/1.5, it lets you place a subject in a scene while focusing the attention on them. I like it most around full body portrait distances or further. 

There are very few other wide aperture 28mm lenses on the market now or in the past from major manufacturers and they've always been expensive (Nikon AF-D and AF-S, Sigma Art, Zeiss Otus, Leica Summilux), so the look is quite uncommon and stands out because of that in my opinion.

Size is quite reasonable on an M body and weight is good as well (especially the lighter weight type 1 matte versions). ""Close"" focus to 0.5m with live view if you want to get tighter.

lq1vbh4,AltruisticCover3005,"I generally dislike in-camera center weighted meters. They do not allow you to meter shadows or highlights precisely and that always left me in quite some doubt. Both your options, M6 and MR, are such meters.

As far as I am concerned there are three types of meters that really work well.

The first is an internal matrix meter, which analyzes the light patterns across the entire frame, allowing the camera to make precise adjustments. The Nikon FA was the first camera to feature such a meter. As for digital Leicas or the M7, I‚Äôm not familiar with their meters, but I know that neither the Leica MR nor the M6 offers matrix metering.

The second type is a tight spot meter, internal or handheld. This is why I consider the M5 to be the best film Leica; it features a fairly narrow metering area, which is clearly indicated.

The third option is a handheld ambient light meter. If the M5 isn‚Äôt an option for you, I recommend investing in a small ambient light meter, such as the Gossen Digisix or Sekonic 208.

Carry it with you every day, whether or not you have a camera on hand. Just walk around, think about the light, consider what exposure you might want to give the current situation using Sunny 16, then check it with your lightmeter. No need to carry a camera for this practice. Once you have done that for a month or so you will find that you actually do not need a meter anymore at all.

But even if you do not want to practice sunny 16 with them, you still will more consistent readings with an ambient meter compared to a center weighted meter, so I‚Äòd probably safe a lot of money by getting a meterless M2, M4, M4-2 or M4-P (no M3, I like 35 mm) and a tiny Sekonic 208 instead of an M6.",7,1727909219.0,2024-10-02 22:46:59,,0,1fusc7z

Now I own an M5 and I consider it the best of the three. Many people do not consider an M5 for its looks and quirks. But I generally feel that people who really dislike it either have never shot one or consider form more important than function.

I bought mine for ‚Ç¨995 in September 2023 from a dealer with a fresh CLA and adjustment to 1.55 V. That was a really good deal. You can occasionally find one for less than ‚Ç¨1000, though usually not freshly CLAed. I would not expect to ever find such a bargain again; usually you pay ‚Ç¨1000-1200 and then have to add a few 100 for a CLA (with risk of paying more if things are found to be defective, but that is always the case).

If you can find a good one for a good price, it certainly will be worth it.

If a handheld ambient meter is an option for you, I have explained that I consider it a very wise decision for learning purposes alone, an M2 might also be a great option, they usually are ‚Äûcheap‚Äú, too, sometimes below ‚Ç¨1000.

lq6cp6a,AnonymousBromosapien,"Honestly, neither.

They are both very expensive for what they are... Im sure she is looking at Leica because its popular and getting a Leica is a sort of status symbol for some... But all the *""Lux""* designated cameras are pretty much expensive for no other reason than by virtue of the *""Leica""* branding.

My advice is to look into the Panasonic LX line instead... Similar if not nearly the same form factor and capablity as their Leica half-siblings and pretty much half the cost in most cases. 

Reality about Leica is its expensive, but only some Leica cameras are accepted as being justifiably expensive *(SL, Q, M lines are the big ones)*, while others such as the *""Lux""* lines are pretty much relying on Leica branding to drive their price. It commonly known in the Leica community the the Lux lines are just Panasonic internals in a Leica branded body... and they arent often recommended or regarded as *""true Leica""* cameras for that reason. 

At the end of the day, to each their own obviously... The intended message here is that your money can otherwise be better spent outside of Leica when it comes to the *""Lux""* series cameras.",3,1727979721.0,2024-10-03 18:22:01,,0,1fvd0m6

But then rational brain me says that for the same $200 you can get her an Olympus E-P1 or E-P2 and a lens and she'll have a much better camera with a larger/better sensor for the same price.

So all the above being said, thoughts expressed, the only additional remark I have on the two cameras is that the V-Lux 40 is 6 years newer and has a higher resolution sensor... whereas the D-Lux 3 came about before the world had fricken iPhones lol.

OK seriously: this is a collapsible Summicron V1, which sells between 500 and 800 EUR (550 - 880 USD) based on its condition. Their front lens is VERY soft; I had one and it was scratched like hell. The images were OK, but I think they were better before. This one seems to be fine.

The M3 is a nice camera; it is the first, it was used by James Bond (Goldfinger) and it has a special place in the heart of many M users. I like 35 mm lenses, so the M3 is not my thing (but the offer of 500 still stands! Because true afficinados will carry an M3 with a 50 glued to it and an M2 with a 35 and never swap lenses anyhow. The more Leicas you carry around your neck, the more professional you look, especially if you combine the look with sandals and white socks)

Currently there is one on Ebay in Germany that looks just as nice as yours for a bit below 1000 EUR (1100 USD). So no, I don't believe the other answers are correct. 2000 - 3000 USD is too much.

Also take the meter off; I am very certain that there will be some ugly marks below it. Ther always are marks under a Leicameter. The Meter itself will probably not work and is worth actually nothing.

Lens and camera together, if they truly are as clean and undamaged as they seem to be on the photos and assumung there are not too many ugly meter marks, could fetch you around 1800 to 2000 EUR (2000 - 2200 USD)",3,1727981527.0,2024-10-03 18:52:07,,0,1fv97rz
lq5c125,SlicedAorta,"double or single stroke (advance lever), an M3 in excellent condition is worth 2k USD or more. for a camera that old, people are going to want to see a CLA done (cleaning, lubricant, and adjustment), and that can cost a few hundred dollars and some time because its an old, complex, and Leica camera. because the camera likely hasn‚Äôt been used in a long time, there‚Äôs a good chance that something on it needs work. lightly but regularly used cameras tend to hold up the best‚Äî if it goes into storage for an extended period, lubricants inside the camera can gum up and you may start having issues with the shutter or film advance. now, you say it seems to be working smoothly, so that is a good thing. try to run some film though it, and if the roll turns out well and you had no operating issues, the camera is probably fine as is.

the one thing I‚Äôm confused about in your post is that it seemed to me that your friend just gave you his old stash of cameras? are you selling his cameras to give back the proceeds, or are you just going to show him what you were able to get back from the sales? if you have to pay him for the M3, pay him a fair rate but do not sell that camera. you‚Äôve already noted what a pleasure it is to hold. whatever profit you get from it is not worth the enjoyment that you can get out of one of the most iconic 35mm‚Äôs ever made.",3,1727967934.0,2024-10-03 15:05:34,,0,1fv97rz

lq4gvqe,mrjosh72,"To answer your questions directly:

* Usually, Summilux lenses are faster (f/1.4), and Summicron lenses are slower and smaller (f/2). But there is no intrinsic difference in quality‚Äîonly in speed.
* In this case, the 43 f/2 Summicron is an ""APO"" lens, whereas the 28 f/1.7 is not. In Leicaland, the APO designation means not just that the lens is apochromatic‚Äîi.e., without purple fringing‚Äîbut also that it has a certain contrast / falloff profile, with higher contrast in the in-focus plane and less in the out of focus plane. This can deliver a certain transparent look that some people really like. ([This](https://www.slack.co.uk/leica-apo-m-lenses.html) is a good overview of the APO M lenses, with many examples images.)
* 43mm is a little odd, but it's not unprecedented at all‚Äîthere have been many very successful 40mm cameras and lenses in the past‚Äîand 40mm is often described as the most 'normal' of the normal focal lengths: it presents subjects without either wide-angle distortion or telephoto compression. [Here](https://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/why-40mm.html) is a good article on the 40mm focal length. I don't believe that there's any meaningful sense in which it helps the lens work better with the sensor; it's more about the field of view, which some people find appealing.

I have no rational reason to want a Q3 43, but I love the 40mm focal length and the way it photographs people in their environments. I'm planning to sate my desire for the Q3 43 by buying a Voigtlander 40mm f/1.2 for my SL2-S.... We'll see how that goes!",15,1727956998.0,2024-10-03 12:03:18,,0,1fv3iyq

lq4p10t,redisburning,"Leica is not Sony/Canon/Nikon. Those brands tend to (though Nikon has changed course recently) position faster lenses as higher budget/quality lenses. And while summiluxes *tend* to cost more than summicrons, Leica doesn't really do ""entry level"" lenses. There are a couple of legacy summicron designs but those lenses were revolutionary when they came out (the 50mm summicron v5, for example, designed in the late 70s, was only bested by high element 50s in the latest generation of mirrorless cameras).

Go on B&H's website and sort by price descending. You'll find the 50 and 35mm APO M summicrons near the top.",3,1727960441.0,2024-10-03 13:00:41,,0,1fv3iyq

For example, mpb had one of these for sale and the cheapest was 3.5k. This was a couple of months ago and they all got sold.

lq0wbnr,Coldkennels,"First, I'm not entirely sure I believe the ""you can't use B&W filters on a colour camera"" idea. There's a lot of interpretation/interpolation/intersomething going on due to the Bayer filter, but it should still work when converted to B&W. That said, I've not tested it myself, so take that with a pinch of salt. I do know what I'm doing tomorrow, though.

However, that is probably the worst possible place to try to test a red filter.

It should go without saying that colour filters lighten complimentary colours and darken opposing colours. What you're probably not taking into account is that indoor lighting is already overwhelmingly warm. Remove the filter, set your camera to a daylight colour balance, and retake the same photo - it'll be heavily yellow/orange. Adding a red filter in front of that won't have anything like the effect you want. 

(Incidentally, in digging for information on flash bulb use, I've found a lot of information from the 20s through to the 40s or 50s where black and white films - even panchromatic ones - were given with two film speeds based on daylight or tungsten lighting. Is that relevant to your situation? Not really. But it does perhaps illustrate that indoor lighting and black and white photography isn't quite as simple as you may think, even without colour filters.)",-1,1727897416.0,2024-10-02 19:30:16,,0,1fujyh6

if you can stretch for a R9 - do it. it's worth a bit of premium over R8, even though it's basically same cam.

they made four times fewer R9s than R8s, so it's less common.

back lit LCD on the R9 for night photography. You wouldn't appreciate it until you tried both cams - it really is a worthy upgrade.

R9 has updated electronic circuitry, updated EV algorithms for auto modes. plus lock button and LCD frame counter on the top . these are kinda meh... but backlit LCD is very useful.

get a winder for it too (not drive), they are not expensive, very useful adder. read the manual when you get the camera  R8 is OK too, but make sure you get the latest serial. do your research on R8 serial numbers and differences - they updated it mid-run.

lpzqarv,P0p_R0cK5,"Update : I‚Äôve finally found out what‚Äôs wrong. 

TL;DR : it‚Äôs the lens that was not correctly calibrated out of the box. 

Long story : 

First of all my Leica IIa is slightly off at infinity on my Elmar and my Canon F2.2. Which is not that much an issue because it is barely noticeable in the rangefinder. 

I guess that‚Äôs because of the tolerance from 1933. I‚Äôm not that much concerned by this since it will mostly be used with a 3.5 lens. 

Now the weird part is the fact that the Heliar use a fixed focusing coupling system which seem to love the slight misalignment of my IIa. 

The inner ring which goes in contact with the rangefinder arm is not turning as you rotate the lens barrel to focus. Interesting conception. 

So the issue is not the M3 or the 7s nor the adapter. It‚Äôs just the lens that came misaligned from factory. And was by coincidence completely fine with my misaligned IIa. 

I will talk about this slight misalignment to my repair guy and see if it is a big deal or not. But it look fine to me. 

I‚Äôve decided to send the lens back where I bought it for calibration. Hope it will work better after that.

lpttnln,Coldkennels,"Very nice choice! As someone whose default camera has been a IIIf since 2012, here's a few tips and things to consider:

* I assume you know about how to cut the leader to fit? Don't listen to anyone who says you can put a film in without recutting the leader. It'll only cause more trouble and problems than its worth.
* If the RF is a tad faint, there's an accessory which helps get more definite focus - it's called an OKARO (or an ORAKO - one is for the earlier cameras, one is for the later cameras, so make sure you get the right one). It's a contrast filter that goes over the front RF window nearest the rewind knob, and it can make a huge difference.
* Buy a NOOKY. They're dirt cheap, small and easy to carry, and give you perfect focusing and framing between 50cm and 1m with that Elmar. I don't use mine often, but it's a handy thing to have in your pocket. Here's a recent photo I took with the NOOKY-HESUM, the version for the Summar: https://mastodon.social/@coldkennels/113056730159804760
* Make sure you keep the slow speed dial set to 25 when you're not using it. You don't want to take a photo expecting a 1/25 only to find it's actually 1/2 a second. That's a mistake you only make once.
* I'm assuming from the shutter speeds on the front dial that it's a ""red dial"" IIIf. If so, the sync dial underneath the shutter speed dial should be set to 0 for electronic flash sync at 1/25 or 20 for electronic flash sync at 1/50. Everything in-between is for bulbs (which are fun and I do recommend you try at some point).
* Rangefinder adjustment on these is incredibly easy if you know what you're doing. Next time you can see the moon on a clear night, point the RF at it and check the images align perfectly when the lens is locked at infinity. If they don't, you'll need two good jewellers' screwdrivers and five minutes.
* Don't buy Soviet lenses for this. [They'll only backfocus](https://flickr.com/photos/coldkennels/13049616063/in/dateposted-public/).",5,1727797719.0,2024-10-01 15:48:39,,0,1ftjir4

lpz2r10,SlicedAorta,"its very, very good. there are a few minor flaws. one is being a bit on the heavy side because its an SLR, over-engineered, and made out of only metal parts. its not excessively heavy or large that it can‚Äôt be handled without both hands. if you‚Äôre using a neck strap, its better to put it over a shoulder to distribute the weight a bit more. the benefit of that is the camera is an absolute tank‚Äî it‚Äôs a lot less likely to have any issues and can handle being tossed around a bit.

its very close to a perfect manual experience. the finder is nice and bright. the advance lever is smooth and has the right amount of tension. if your light meter is working, it definitely adds to the experience. accurate near-spot TTL metering on a camera from the 1960‚Äôs is kind of insane to me still. the camera lost its mirror lockup switch from the Leicaflex Standard for a DoF preview button, which is helpful for stop-down metering but not much else, because the finder naturally gets darker the more you stop down. this is compounded by a focusing screen that isn‚Äôt that great, having only a microprism isn‚Äôt that ideal. i suppose that‚Äôs what zone focusing is for. 

I‚Äôm really interested in getting a Leica R6 sometime down the road, so I can use my R lenses but get a little more newer tech. i highly value the fully mechanical capabilities of the SL and thats why I‚Äôm only interested in an R6. i don‚Äôt want batteries for shutter speed, and im not interested in AE or AF when shooting film. this camera does everything I want it to, and nothing else.",1,1727876241.0,2024-10-02 13:37:21,,0,1ftjir4

lpt28en,WombatMcGeez,"I‚Äôve been through all the iterations in a similar situation to yours.  My kids at 7 & 4 now, and I started with Fuji, then progressed through the Q2, M11, Q3, M11-P over the last 4 years

My takeaway:

1. It‚Äôs really frustrating when you miss focus on the M11.  However, you learn to compensate.  Kids running around?  I‚Äôm going to shoot at F4 or even up to F8, and I‚Äôve gotten better at adjusting focus as they move, but TBH I have a ways to go. Starting with the M11 with a newborn is the perfect time, because the baby won‚Äôt move much.  You‚Äôll have time to dial in your technique as junior grows up.

2. I realized that there are already SO many more pictures of my kids than there were of ANY of us in the 80s and 90s.  Even if I miss 80% of my shots, there are still going to be a lot of pictures of us.

3. I have an iPhone in my pocket, as do most people around me.  If I really need AF, then that‚Äôs the tool.

4. The manual shooting experience just feels so much better.  Looking through glass, and not at a screen.  And when you nail the shot, it feels really good.  When I pick up a camera with an EVF now, I have what feels like almost an allergic reaction.  I want to put it down and go back to my M11.

5. The white-balance issue is overblown, as long as you shoot in raw.  It takes seconds to fix WB on a photo in LR.  Generally, I‚Äôll apply basic adjustments to the first photo of a set with similar lighting conditions, copy those settings and apply them to the whole set, and use that as my starting point.

Final verdict: buy the M.  Embrace it.  Welcome to the clubs (M club and fatherhood club), they‚Äôre both fantastic!",12,1727788247.0,2024-10-01 13:10:47,,0,1ftl4v4
lpspssz,dinomagnet,"Think all things have already been mentioned, but another benefit of a camera that _does_ have autofocus means it will probably also be easier for others to take photos with that camera _of you and your kid(s)_. All photos of me are iPhone photos because nobody understands how to use my M. Now I don't have kids, but I can imagine it's nice to have good photos of you with your kid(s) as well.

I've had people offer to take a photo with my camera but either it will require a quick tutorial on how to use it, or they claim they know how it works (""I've done photography!"") yet clearly don't because I can see the focus tab is pointing the wrong way for the distance I'm at, resulting in a very blurry photo.

With good enough light and depending on focal length you could try to preset it for zone focussing, before letting someone take the photo. But even then it's not guaranteed as they might move something, like the aperture ring thinking it's the focus ring (yes I've seen this happen too).

Having said all of that, I love my M's. My partner at least learned how to use it, but doesn't like using it because it's too expensive and thinks she might break it and is always afraid that it gets stolen.

One thing I haven‚Äôt seen anyone else address is the colors and your comment that you want photos that look as natural as possible. By default the Leica‚Äôs tend to give you a punchy slightly over saturated look. All of mine shift more magenta than I would like (especially in lower light). It‚Äôs a beautiful look but I wouldn‚Äôt call it natural. For my paid work (studio and environmental portraiture) I‚Äôve switched over to Hasselblad simply because it handles skin tones so much better than anything I have used. If you haven‚Äôt shot with a Leica before I would encourage you to borrow one from your local store for a day and see if the color is what you expect it to be.",3,1727793997.0,2024-10-01 14:46:37,,0,1ftl4v4

I'm done with autofocus and find it quite frustrating after years with the M. I shoot wide open most of the time. My hit rate is high, but I'll always have a iphone in my pocket as well. Never will I grab the iphone unless I absolutely have to....likewise with the AF options I have. The ergonomics, simplicity, and beautiful images win me every time.

Downsides that I'm willing to own:

Overall I am satisfied with the yield of good images. You do have to adjust expectations compared to digital mirrorless; you‚Äôre not going to nail focus wide open on a fast moving subject with spray-and-pray technique.

while the ""cropping power"" seems like a great idea for music photography in concept, what's really lost is the ability for a telephoto lens in the 75 to 90mm range to compress the background -- the lighting design, or other instrumentalists behind a lead singer, etc in a larger venue. cropping into a 43 doesn't give the same amount of compression, even though the field of view could be similar

3) In referencing point #2‚Ä¶.always hold the barrel of the lens at the aperture and front edge when taking on or off the #12536 locking pin style hood [or just leave it alone], as the bayonet style locking hood is famous for the cause of the barrel becoming loose.  Also, always take the lens on and off the camera body by the barrel and NOT holding the lens hood! If this is followed then this lens will be good for another 50 years and no issues!

lpn2lab,papichulofilm,"Everyone's saying ""Oh, then what's the point of you buying it then?"" but to them, maybe a Leica is just another camera. Some people just have money to burn but to people like me or possibly even you, it could mean months or years of saving up for.

I'm in the same situation as you. I'm even considering getting another cheap phone just for travelling just so my main phone doesn't get stolen. Its very likely that I'll still bring my Leica along with me. I'll just make sure that I grip it tight and be **A LOT** more aware of the people around me. I also probably wouldn't have it out in packed/crowded places or when its dark out.

Its really up to you. Swiss seems like a decent place to have a camera out. Italy seems less safe in comparison in its touristy places but still doable. Just be cautious and aware of your surroundings the more people there are around you. Watch the people around you and how they look at you. If they seem suspicious, remove yourself from the situation. Be careful of people on bikes.",1,1727699661.0,2024-09-30 12:34:21,,0,1fst3la

lphc497,AltruisticCover3005,"I paid 995 EUR for mine in September 2023. But mine came from a German professional vendor who had it CLAed by a professional and experienced technician prior to sale. So everything on my works perfectly and the meter is adjusted to modern 1.55 V batteries. It is not the prettiest M5 (the paint is a bit greyish and there is a dent in the top plate), but it works perfectly.

So 850 EUR sounds cheap at first glance. But if it is a private sale, keep in mind that this camera probably has not seen a service shop since 1972. It might look fine and the shutter mit work, but you cannot know what is inside.

If you do what I would do, this camera will cost you at least 500 EUR more in the end. It still would be OK, considering this specific camera is looks very nice; most M5 have more scratches and dents (which means nothing as long as the work perfectly).



A bit of personal crazyness: I am the kind of person who thinks: I pay a lot of money for film, I spend a lot of my spare time on this hobby, so I deserve a camera that is working to perfect standards, shooting bad cameras is a waste of time and money.

For that reason I either buy cameras that have been CLAed within the last 5 years by a respectable repair shop (yes, I check where they have been repaired and if the technician has a qualification for the model) OR I will buy it without service (then for considerably less money) and immediately ship it to a technician without even putting a film in for testing. I am not happy with ""well, it seems to be OK."" I want a written document by a specialist confirming that everything is ok.

Maybe I should test for OCD.

10 years ago I looked for ages for a near mint black Nikon F2AS (The only time in my life I looked for a camera that had to look nice). It took months, because I wanted one with a serial number starting with 776, Why? I was born at the beginning of November, 776 was the serial number used in October and November of my birth year so my F2 is to 30 days as old as I am. 

Crazy? Of course, but I am 46 years old and I like what I like and I want what I want.

Knowing that the best service technician for F2 Nikons is Mr. Sover Wong from Nottingham, UK and that Sover had a backlist of months, I contacted him and asked him to book me a CLA slot for a F2AS long before I finally found the actual camera.

lphdh11,AltruisticCover3005,"Yes, the prices are very high. In 2014 I bought two M Leicas.

First I bought an M3 single stroke including a rigid Summicron Type 2 for 867 EUR in an Ebay auction. I later found out it had been CLAed at Leica in 2004 at which time the original damaged rangefinder had been replaced by a new 0.85 so it worked perfectly with 35 mm lenses - great camera and it actually even looked quite nice, not many scratches. The camera alone goes for 1200 today and of course without a CLA and certainly not with a new rangefinder. And the lens can be bought for around 800 EUR, close to what I paid for the bundle.

Later that year I paid 595 EUR for a Leica M6 in a camera shop in Germany. It was a really ugly camera, the black was greyish verywhere and it had a few dings, but it worked and after 250 EUR for a CLA it was technically perfect. That camera, CLAed, would be on the lowest price bracket today, but you probably would still pay in excess of 2000 EUR.

In 2017 I bought an M2 with a Summaron 35, collapsible Summicron 50 and Elmar 90, all in decent shape, for 1258 EUR, also in an ebay auction. Good old times when Ebay was what it was supposed to be!



In 2014 you could buy a new Leica MP fresh from the dealer for 4000 EUR.



Nevertheless, we don't live in 2014, we live in 2024 and the prices are what they are. Leica increased the prices for an MP from 4000 EUR to 5900 EUR and used prices went up as well.

Eye-tracking autofocus? Absolute game-changer for photographing people! So, when Canon finally dropped the R5/R6, I came running back. Their first attempt at eye focus was pretty impressive.

My reasoning:

My digital camera is a Sony A7RII. The model was released in 2015, almost 10 years ago, and I bought mine about 2 years after the release of the A7RIII, as one of the last in stock at a local photo store at a very heavy discount.

To this day, I see no reason to upgrade to an A7RIII or A7RIV.

Digital cameras reached a VERY high level of quality sometime between 2012 and 2015, and mine is still up to date. Newer cameras have faster autofocus and slightly better low-light performance, but I've never found anything lacking in my almost 10-year-old digital camera.

I'm absolutely NOT interested in a Q camera. They do nothing for me. But I understand why other people love them. And believe me, 10 years from now, Q cameras will still be capable of producing great results.

Just like my Sony, they probably won‚Äôt be ""forever"" cameras. Electronics can fail. But one should never fool oneself into thinking that mechanical cameras are built to last forever either. At some point, even for a mechanical camera, the spare part will no longer be available. And when a roll of black-and-white film costs 25 EUR or USD, some might question whether they want to continue down that path.

I love my various film cameras; most of them are mechanical, a few have an electronic shutter and aperture priority, none of them have autofocus. But I admit: they are outdated technology. If I were only concerned with getting a result, I wouldn‚Äôt use them. Digital photography can do practically everything you want, and with the right filters for Likghtroom, you can even mimic the look of classic films fairly well.

Your idea of buying a camera that‚Äôs already obsolete out of fear that your Q might become obsolete seems to me like an incredibly bad reason to start the hobby of analog photography.

I shoot 90% of my photos on film, and 90% of that is in black and white. The films are digitized using the Sony and a macro lens ^((which is why my Sony also has by far the most shutter actuations; every shot from any of my film cameras inevitably leads to at least one shutter actuation on my Sony)). Then I cut my films and put them in film sleeves, which I label and file according to my personal folder system. The digital images are converted into positives with Negative Lab Pro, stored in folders on my NAS that are numbered exactly like the film sleeves. The digital images are then essentially my contact sheets. The digital files allow me to decide which negative to take down to the darkroom to print a proper picture on baryta paper.

I find working in the darkroom even more enjoyable than actually being out shooting photos, because only here, in the darkroom, can I watch live as the image develops and becomes real for me personally.

If you find joy in such a process, then you have a good reason to shoot analog. Entering a hybrid analog-digital process because you really enjoy it: Also fine; not my cup of tea, but who am I to judge what other people enjoy.

But doing so out of fear that your digital camera might someday get old seems to me like a very poor idea.",0,1727636374.0,2024-09-29 18:59:34,,0,1fsaswo
lpj8af6,armevans,"This is a good take, I think. People tend to think cameras (and other things, too) get outdated far more quickly than they do. The DSLRs used by photojournalists in the early 2000s are ‚Äúout of date,‚Äù but photos taken with them still are celebrated and circulated. Just because there will be multiple generations of newer cameras with ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù features compared to the original Q doesn‚Äôt mean that the Q is any worse of a camera. Comparison is the thief of joy, etc.

Now, batteries and screens and AF motors and stuff will wear out at some point, and 10 or 20 years from now, parts availability and servicing may become a point of concern. An analog M is more likely to be serviceable for longer given the lack of electronics. But in just the last few years, the cost of film and the cost of developing and scanning has gone up significantly. How will that change over the next two decades? Are you ready related to store a lifetime of negatives, slides, and/or prints?

As another commenter pointed out, buying ‚Äúfor a lifetime‚Äù isn‚Äôt common with cameras (or most things). Who knows how your needs will change over the coming decades? Both the MP and Q will remain excellent cameras by many metrics (assuming you take good care of them), but that doesn‚Äôt help you if you suddenly find that you need features not found on either camera.

lprmrli,jshell,"The X1, being the oldest, also seems to have the most issues of the fixed prime X cameras. And mine shows most of them. I got it used for $450 USD a couple of years ago, knowing it had some issues but willing to tolerate them. Some of these seem somewhat to fairly common on the X1 at this age:

* If battery is removed, the internal date/time clock has to be reset.
* The little battery holder clip is gone. Works fine when battery door is closed but battery pops out when opening just to get SD card, causing clock to be reset. (But one can get pictures off the camera by USB, alas it doesn't seem to charge by USB).
* Autofocus is definitely slow and then slow again. But pictures are nice. It's a good lens.
* But the collapsing lens doesn't always collapse, sometimes leading to a few cycles of turning the camera off and on to get the lens back in.
* I haven't experienced this but I've seen it mentioned on some eBay listings where the flash no longer stays down.

I *think* most of these issues were fixed with the X2. The X2 definitely had a longer lifespan (into the X-E and the X Vario is also based on it; not sure of the X Typ 113). But I like the purely-flat top of the X1. Putting an old old old school viewfinder really makes it feel like a bridge between early 20th and early 21st century cameras.

But as I like it more than I expected, I am kind of wishing I had gone for an X2 (or just an X1 in better condition).

I did have an X Typ 113 for a few days a couple of years back. But its aperture blades were stuck wide open. It looked fine in its eBay listing with test shots, but they were all shot inside. And it worked great inside for me too but once outside, everything was blown out even when trying to set f16 and 1/1000 shutter. I haven't heard of that being a common issue. I returned it to the seller.

And damn if I don't still miss that X Typ 113. Even though I have T and TL and should just get the TL23mm f2 lens. But I really like the X's.

Landscapes work with narrower fl because a landscape is almost never about the width of the picture ; it‚Äôs about the relationship of foreground, middle ground and background, and you don‚Äôt need a wide frame to make good use of that.

Based on my experience, taking pictures of my 3 years-old daughter at home, the 28mm is much better than the 43mm, especially because she keeps moving, so the 43mm would be too tight.

Both are good for landscapes and it depends if you want to capture more of the scene or be able to crop closer to your subject. It‚Äôs a tough decision, but for mountain pictures, I‚Äôd go for the 43mm. Bare in mind that the 28mm is still capable of taking astrophotography, the 43mm may be a bit too narrow for that.

lpd9im0,cookedart,"Lots of excitement for the q3 43 because it's shiny and new. 

But the q3 28 is the more sensible choice, in my opinion. The lens, combined with the 60mp sensor, essentially makes it work as well as a full frame mirrorless camera with a 24-70mm lens for me, especially since the telephoto end of that is less useful for me personally. I think this because the lens is actually more like a 26mm lens, and the 50mm crop mode is still operating at f/2.8 equivalent.

I use the camera all the time in 35mm crop mode, which basically functions as a 35mm f/2 and is brilliant as a bring everywhere setup. In this mode, it gives you some play to reframe in post too, and has a rangefinder feel as you can see outside your composition. 

I also think the 28mm f/1.7 is fairly special. There aren't a lot of close equivalents in the mirrorless world, especially those that are small and optically as excellent as the lens is in the q3 28. Contrasting that with excellent plethora of 35, 40, and 50mm options that would compare close to the q3 43, I think it just makes the q3 28 a more unique camera. It's then possible to pair it with another small mirrorless that covers ultra wide (15-21mm) or short telephoto (55mm or longer) and you have a very versatile setup that can be very lightweight and covers a huge amount of subjects. 

To me, the q3 43 seems nice if your main subjects are environmental portraits. But it writes it off as say, and landscape lens, which the q3 28 is more naturally suited to do, and can also handle environmental portraits as well.

Personally, I don't see any pull or or advantage to the q3 43 to me.",8,1727544566.0,2024-09-28 17:29:26,,0,1fri9jc
lpd9sjx,ah_long,"It depends on your subject

For what you are doing, 28mm would be the better choice.

To elaborate:

28mm would be better if you want to photograph people that you already know such as your daughter. I'm using mine for that same purpose. Chances are that you're already in close proximity to the subject that you are photographing, 28mm would allow you to capture more of the surrounding as well. Imagine sitting at a restaurant or playing with your daughter, you would need to take a step or two back to take that shot if you are shooting with a 43mm. 28mm would also be better for landscapes.

  
I would take the 43mm if you plan to do a lot of street photography of people and would like that extra bit of reach. 

  
At the end of the day, you can crop to 43mm from a 28mm, but not the other way around.",6,1727544658.0,2024-09-28 17:30:58,,0,1fri9jc

I‚Äôve been watching the Camera West YouTube video, a chap from Leica San Francisco going round with both Q3‚Äôs and there‚Äôs STILL no answer. Sometimes 28mm is better, sometimes it‚Äôs 43mm.  Quite often, it just doesn‚Äôt matter. For every shot where the 43mm looks too narrow and bloated, there‚Äôs a 28mm shot with thick bands of sky & foreground that add nothing to the scene‚Ä¶

lpgtzz0,OnePhotog,"I don't think I will be able to help make your indecision any easier. However, I hope I can provide some perspective.

1. There is a lot of hype around it because it is the shiny new thing. Since the original Q came out, people have been asking for a longer focal length, like a 50mm or a 35mm. People in the leica-fandom say the same thing over and over again, comparing the Q to the Ricoh GR. Where is the 50mm Q when the GR with the 40mm came out. Where is the 50mm Q, when sony came out with the RX1.  So I hope this helps to understand why there is so much hype. 

People have also gravitated to the Q because the 28mm focal length is so similar to what the mobile phone's default focal length. This means people who pick up the Q are immediately familiar with the focal length. It makes learning how to use it so much easier. 

2. The second perspective requires you to be more introspective and know who you are as a photographer, and the images you are trying to make with the camera. If you know you gravitate towards the 50mm focal length, you should exchange the Q for the Q43. This was similar to my situation where I am really tempted by a convenient 43mm focal length to compliment my use of the 50mm focal length. At the moment, I am trying to just shoot more with the current 50mm focal length until I reach a point were I say I can't manual focus anymore. Then, I'll give the Q43 another look. 

Another approach is to look at hte one camera you have and the focal length it has. Or the most common focal length you use with that camera. Then you have two options. First option, use the focal length similar to the camera you use in the hope that the Q (which ever version) will completely replace the other camera. Or the second option is to get the opposite focal length so that it compliments the camera and lenses you are already using.",3,1727600898.0,2024-09-29 09:08:18,,0,1fri9jc

When the 43 came out I was thinking about it pretty hard. I‚Äôm mainly a 35 shooter. The only 2 50s I‚Äôve had was the 50lux and 50GM on Sony. 50GM was my only lens so I forced myself to shoot with a 50. On the M I grab the 35 every time when I have to choose between 35 and 50. 50 just isn‚Äôt my focal length.

When I last travelled, I had a 35/40/50/24-70 the lens I used the most was 24-70. My most used focal length was 24, and 70. In smaller tighter spaces, Asia populated cities 35 is often not wide enough. And often I would use 70 to do landscape(city scapes) of the streets from a far distance(couple blocks away).

After I returned from my trip, I‚Äôve decided to get a Q3. I had the Q2 but it wasnt for me. I‚Äôm exploring 28mm all over again. So far the Q3 feels great.

lqqlxfo,Professional_Sun4455,"I had a choice between the 28mm and the 43mm and I bought the new one based on the type of lens, not the focal length. I really enjoyed shooting on my Q2M at 28mm but as I shoot on my M11M mostly these days, I sold the Q2M. As I'm missing a water resistant street camera, I looked to a colour Q3, either the 28mm summilux or the 43mm apo summicron. Ultimately they render differently and I love the colors on my M11 with the 35mm APO or my SL3 with the 50 or 35mm APO SLs. Granted, I have an absurd amount of choice in my stable and I'm pretty lucky but that also means I have no need to justify the choices I've made. As such, I would recommend the lens that will get you out to shoot most often. Either you will miss the wide angle with 28mm or you will always want to shoot with the APO; I'm of the latter camp. 

I also tend to shoot with a 50mm or a 35mm, rarely a 28mm. Don't let people tell you that 28mm is the only way to do street; you can always grab your phone if you need 28mm or wider in a pinch. If you can afford a Q3 then you can always afford another camera like a Zf or a smaller Fuji if you need to access other focal lengths.

lpdhqik,photodesignch,"You need to ask why you sold all your Fujifilm gears and what focal lengths you are more comfortable with.

You‚Äôve mentioned 100 series is one you had most photos so far. But you need to provide information of WHY.

1) is it because the compactness so you use x100 more than X-T? Then Q isn‚Äôt for you! Q is huge and bulky compare to X100

2) you like x100 due to wide angle focal length, and you have many lenses on XT how come you didn‚Äôt line XT more?  Since XT with wide angle lenses is relatively similar package to Q.  So are you taking more photos on X100 is due to pocketable (reason 1)?

If you can answer these two questions yourself then you will know which Q to get. Because you took most of photos on x100 isn‚Äôt due to focal length. It‚Äôs mostly something to do with compactness.  Then both Qs aren‚Äôt going to help you. They are bigger, heavier and you are less likely to pocket it like a x100.

But size wasn‚Äôt the issue! Wide 28mm is your thing. The. Q2! Simple as that!  And you can soft crop into 43 if you want.

Q3 43 is for specific people who like 35, 40, 50 focal length people.

One last thing. There is no such thing as ‚Äúsimplicity of single lens camera‚Äù. When you can change lenses! Just mount ONE lens only. Then you get your simplicity. That point is just pointless.

And if you want Q3 43 but don‚Äôt need 61mp. Just use Fuji camera with 27mm/2.  That gives you roughly the 41mm perspective! Super close to the Q3 renders!  And if you can give up on autofocus! You can use voigtlander 27/2.  Not only you can achieve Q3 43mm relative POV, you also get close up near macro range, F2 aperture, and x100v compact in size (yes! Pocketable).

I use Sony a7c, Fuji x, Leica q, Leica x interchangeably with proper lenses!  I never really see the exact NEEDS I need to have Q because image quality they are very consistent cross brands!

My point with 28mm and kids is that, I you‚Äôre at home, usually you don‚Äôt have enough space to move back. These are moments you‚Äôre playing with them and therefore very close to them. The best pictures I take from my daughter are usually when she‚Äôs playing with something. Also, if they move a lot (which is the case of my daughter), they will not run out of field of view too easily. 
But I agree that a 43mm for portraits or for taking pictures in your backyard or playground will be better.

Then if you consider that you can always crop on the 28mm and having two camera bodies may be too much for a lot of us, the 28mm would be more appropriate I guess, but very subjective.",2,1727594367.0,2024-09-29 07:19:27,,0,1fri9jc

lpeqo1a,calmkelp,"I went with a Q3 for a few reasons.  
  
1. I really liked the constraint of the fixed focal length. I enjoyed the Fuji X100 models that I had, so I wanted something similar, but with higher image quality. I was considering going after the Fujifilm X100 VI, but that's hard to get, and I think the Leica will be superior. I know I could get an M with a single prime lens, but I also know myself well enough to know I'd be unlikely to stop at just one, and then things get complicated (and very expensive).

2. The M11 body alone costs more than the Q3, and then you need lenses and those can be crazy expensive. The Q3 was about as extravagant as I'm willing to go right now.

3. Related to cost, I'm just not someone who can relish in the good deal of buying used, or a previous model. I end up only being interested in buying new and the latest model. Unfortunately I've got a bad case of the upgrades, like a new iPhone every year.

lph2mdd,AltruisticCover3005,"Most people here will tell you to pass on both. I do not necessarily agree. There are some thoughts first.

But because people sometimes are impatient, let me start with a TL;DNR:

I'd definitly pass on the M5. I would consider the M6 based on its real condition. If it is looking well, the CLA was made by a technician who knows what he/she's doing and if there are no other issues except the non-working meter AND if you are ok with a non-metered camera and would also consider an M2, M3, M4, M4-2 or **M4-P** ^((read on if you want to know why I wrote M4-P in bold letters)) if you find one for a good price, this M6 would be the camera I'd probably buy and be very happy with the purchase.

And here's my reasoning:

# No on the M5:

I'm living in Germany and I bought my M5 freshly CLAd for 1000 EUR (=1170 USD) in September 2023. It is not the prettiest, has a little dent in the top plate and the black color is a a bit greyish (something to be seen on many M5, M4-P and M6), but it works perfectly and of course it was also calibrated to modern 1.55 V batteries.

So I got a freshly maintained camera for the same price you get a camera ""in working condition"". ""in working condition"" basically means: The shutter will  release somehow but everything may be completely off, you cannot really use it with confidence.

So you must add another 500 or so USD to get it working well and who knows what they find to be damaged in the process; it could get even more expensive.

I personally did own an M6 years ago and now own an M5 and from a shooter's perspective I prefer the M5 to the M6 despite it being a bit less pretty, because the M5 is equipped with a needle meter, a big shutter wheel that I can easily adjust while looking through the finder, a very tight spot meter whose metering area is indicated in the rangefinder as well and a shutter speed indication in the rangefinder; as a metered camera it simply works better for me than the M6.

But the one you got offered is to expensive if it has not been CLAed.

# Possibly a Yes on the M6:

An M6, recently maintained with a non functional meter is basically an **M4-P** ^((now you understand the bold letters)) with the option of spending a lot of money later to replace the meter (I read that Leica found a way to install the current MP meter for a ton of money and a few days ago somebody presented a new aftermarket metering board here, so there will be options).

Now here's the point: The M6 comes at $1600, wich is roughly ‚Ç¨1490, which is the price M4-P cameras sell for here in Germany UN-CLAed! So for $1600, you would get an M4-P ""in working condition"" and I already said what I think about that. If you can get an M4-P with a fresh CLA for that price, I would definitly say go for it.

A CLAed M6 with a working meter goes for at least ‚Ç¨1000 more.

If I do not need an internal meter and if I had the option to buy a CLAed M6 with a broken meter, wich basically is an M4-P now, for the price of an un-CLAed M4-P, I would definitly consider it.

You will get a very nice camera. And if there will be an aftermarket circuit board available in the future, it might be cheaper than ‚Ç¨1000 to have it installed ^((might also be more expensive, who knows, so do not consider it as a deciding factor)), so you might be able to buy a CLAed quasi-M4-P for a very decent price with the option of upgrading it to full M6 status later without overpaying for what an M6 is worth nowadays.",2,1727606926.0,2024-09-29 10:48:46,,0,1frszt8

Spend your money on something that works and that you can use the day you get it in your hands.

Seriously, a freshly CLA'd M5 can be found for $1,100-1,400, effectively cutting out a 4 month CLA wait for the same cost. 

And if you are really ok with buying an M6 with a non-functional meter... just buy an M4/M4-2/M4-P instead for the same $1,600.

So really deoends on how much less than $1k were talking here... If were talkin like $900, then no its not worth it. $900 for the M4-P + $350 for the CLA + $100 for parts + $250 for repair labor puts you are $1,600 all in.

Keep in mind... thats an estimate as well as an assumption that the only repairs and parts needed is the shutter curtain. Pretty much anything else is wrong with it and you are well within the realm of *""not worth it at all""*. 

You also have to consider that you are not only going to shell out however much just to get the M4-P... but then send if off immediately to start the clock ticking on the several month turnaround that the CLA and repairs will take. I.e. you could very easily find yourself 4 months and $1,700+ deep in this M4-P and still not have taken a single picture with it yet lol.

lpax5m4,butangmucat,"Ever since I knew that there's a version 2 of Summaron 35/3.5 LTM (E39 filters that do not rotate, just like the M mount version) I had been trying to hunt down one. Our local Leica store had one last month but I missed it, but today I finally got one at the price of a regular Summaron 35 3.5 (499 incl. shipping for a clean copy that also came with a Leitz UV filter).

Now I have the dilemma: which viewfinder to use (at least for a few months)?
- LLL Weisu + Canon parallax compensator - the Weisu finder itself works pretty well except for close-up, not sure how the parallax compensator changes that yet.
- Voigtlander Kontour - bought as a curiosity item but absolutely love it as I wear prescription glasses, but did not get a chance to test the close-up accuracy yet as the latter just arrived in the mail.
- Metro Case VF - someone here recommended it to me, but not sure if it was my donor Canon SureShot's problem, the framelines tend to disappear under backlit conditions, though second best eye relief, just behind the Kontour.
- Accura Tele-Wide - bought as a curiosity item too and similar to the Yashica Tele-Wide but built with metal and has parallax compensation. The ""wide"" framelines seem to agree with the Metro Case VF, and my test roll at 5ft+ seem to be pretty good.
- Canon VIOOH copy - this is the version II and is designed to work with Canon V and VI, so it lacks standalone parallax compensation knob; but it does have the screw threads for the 28mm VF attachment so I can also use it with my 28mm GR Lens (which is still in transit from KEH). Did not get a chance to check the accuracy of the 35mm frame yet as it just arrived in the mail. I plan to keep either this or the Foca VF as they are very similar in terms of offering (28 and 35 in the same finder).
- Foca turret viewfinder - the 28mm setting seem to agree with my Ricoh GR Lens bright line finder and the 35mm setting seem to agree with with both the Metro Case VF and the Accura Tele-Wide. Did not get a chance to run it through film though.

I will probably eventually get a LLL SBLOO but it won't be until either later this year (around Black Friday) or even next year. So in the meantime I'll probably have to work with those as none of my M bodies (M3 and Rollei 35 RF) have 35mm framelines. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

With that being said I am open to letting my Rollei 35 RF go in exchange of a body that has 35 frames (Bessa R2m/R2a, M2, M4-P, or even Zeiss Ikon ZM), or maybe I should let my 35 lenses stay on the Rollei and just use the 40 frame lines.

I have had the same experience.. I thought exactly how you thought.. but I sort of understand it now.. 

I'm using it as my fancy printer.. and when you print, you get to save a photo with an Instax border for sharing with friends.. it's a nice touch if you don't wanna print the same photo and you get to save a digital copy.. although I'd say beware that the app crashes on my iphone 14 pro max after printing 20-30 photos at a time..so I try to save the bordered printed photo when I can.. 

It has its quirks here and there.. but feels much more solid than the Fujifilm Evo.. although, picture quality wise, not sure it's better than the Evo.. build quality and looks, I'm a sofort 2 fan all the way.. the Fuji app is a bit more fun for editing and adding ""stickers"" while the leica feels serious.. but transfers on the leica app is amazingly fast compared to other camera app I have..

lpa28s4,mrjosh72,"I think the focus issue is overblown. Kids are not actually that challenging to photograph. (I have two.) It just takes practice. The real question is what kinds of images you want to produce.

If your goal is to produce very sharp, modern photographs, then I think it's hard to beat the Q3 and Q3 43. Or an SL-series camera with the APO-Summicron primes. Certainly the 43mm APO lens on the Q3 43 seems pretty unbeatable, as modern lenses go.

However, if your desired aesthetic is different, then the M-mount offers you unparalleled access to a huge world of lenses, all with different looks. You can range backwards through the decades of photography by using different lenses.

I was a Q2 shooter for many years, but ultimately left that camera behind because I decided that the modern look wasn't what I wanted. I wanted to shoot with lenses like the Zeiss Sonnar, which offer a gentler rendering for people. Today my most-used lenses, on my M10-R and -M, are the 35 Steel Rim and 50 f/1.2 Noctilux reissues. The Q3 43 is undeniably amazing, but since I don't want to produce ultra-sharp APO-type photographs, it's not the tool for me. If I \*did\* want to produce those kinds of pictures‚Äîfor instance, if my main M lenses were the 35 FLE, 50 Lux ASPH, and 75 Apo-Summicron‚Äîthen I'd seriously consider switching to a Q3 43.

The image quality between the two is so close that most people won‚Äôt notice. The logical conclusion is to sell the M11 too and keep the lenses for when the kids are older and photography as a hobby is a thing again (instead of as the family documentarian) but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to let it go‚Ä¶.

lpd9ybu,pbwj21,"I just purchased the M11-P while my Leica Q3 was in service. I also use it primarily to take pictures of my kids, so I can give you my two cents. 

I just compare it like choosing a manual car over an automatic. The manual allows for more direct control (changeable lenses, deeper engagement with the process). The Q3 is just a great all rounder - nice autofocus, built in macro lens functionality, video recording, and weather sealing.   
  
I've been testing out several lenses with the M11-P (28mm elmarit, 35mm f/1.4 ASPH, and 35mm silver rim). The M11 definitely slows you down (similar to driving a manual car in stop and go traffic) however this slower pace allows for a more deliberate and thoughtful process. With a manual focus camera, you're more involved in composing the shot, paying attention to the fine details. 

I think it ultimately comes down to convenience - Q3 is the perfect travel camera. Very versatile and you can even get your friends/family to take photos for you. For kids it's great - try focusing on your kids running in and out... the autofocus on Q3 is awesome IMO. 

I take my Q3 for traveling but recently I've been using the M11 + iPhone when I want to take quick pics or video. The M11 also IMO is ergonomically better and lighter (depending on the lens ofc).",2,1727544712.0,2024-09-28 17:31:52,,0,1fr2db7

After shooting almost exclusively with my M11 for the past 6 months, I agree that the Q3 does feel somewhat like a toy.  But go and play with any other mirrorless camera from Fuji, Sony etc. and the Q3 suddenly feels much more refined.

For me, the image quality point is moot and it‚Äôs really a question of handling and experience. There are times I prefer to compose through an optical finder and enjoy manual focusing while in other situations, I enjoy the precision of an EVF and the various technical perks of the Q3.

If I had to choose one system, it would most likely be the M11 because it compels me to shoot more often due to the overall experience. However, practically speaking, the Q3 probably makes more sense.

lpc943e,mrjosh72,"I definitely hear you‚ÄîI have two young kids, and going out with them can be not just photographically but athletically challenging!

That said, I think it's all about trade-offs. With an M, you can easily use a wide lens, set your aperture to f/8, and 'be there.' And then you can shoot one handed very easily, with everything in focus, without even raising the camera to your eye. The trade-off is that you have more depth of field. So the question then becomes, is being able to shoot at wide apertures one-handed worth using the Q system in favor of the M system? That's an aesthetic question. It has to do with how much you like shallow DOF. There are definitely people for whom that trade-off makes sense, but it's not set in stone. For me, personally, I often prefer photographs with more depth of field.

I think the same goes for autofocus in general. A lot of people will say that, with an M, they fail to nail focus in certain situations‚Äîe.g., when their kid is running straight towards them. Setting aside the fact that you actually can nail this shot with pre-focusing, the question becomes: is the difficulty of getting this kind of shot (and certain others) worth adopting the Q system instead of the M system? Again, it's about trade-offs‚Äîbecause there are strengths the M system has (lenses, OVF, rangefinder, vibe, etc.) that one is giving up in exchange. My personal conclusion has been that those kinds of 'action shots' are not a major part of my photographic 'brief' when taking pictures of my family.

I'm in no way saying that someone who leaves the M behind when they have kids is wrong to do so. Horses for courses, etc. Just arguing that the equation ""kids = autofocus"" doesn't necessarily have to be true, depending on your goals.",6,1727531859.0,2024-09-28 13:57:39,,0,1fr2db7

I didnt necessarily switch but I have a ton of cameras lol. X-T4, X100V, X-E3, all the ones listed in my flair, D850, etc.

I like the Q much better than any of my Fujifilm cameras. From my perspective, the Fujis are just *fun messing around and play with film sims*, and the Q just absolutely smokes all of them. Like if I absolutely had to pick... I would offload my X-T4, X100V, and X-E3 before letting go of just my Q. I could happily shoot B&W on the Q all day every day over Fujis film sims.

I think the caveat to the above being that I hsve other cameras as well. Idk if id offload all my Fujis if the only camera id have was just a Q.

>Do you wish it had IBIS?

Nah. Years ago when IBIS was like the hot new thing I cared about it... but now I honestly dont even ever think about IBIS.

>How long have you owned out and/or how long do you plan on owning it? 

Since like 2015/2016. Forever, ill just put it up in a shelfnwhen it dies. But im also a camera hoarder lol.

>What sucks?

For a *""compact camera""* its pretty big. I guess I dont really think that sucks, just that compared to my X100V that I can stick in a coat pocket and not even know its there, the Q might as well just be an interchangeable lens camera lol.

The lens hood... its pretty much intended to stay on the lens at all times. I.e. The lens cap doesnt fit in the lens as well as it does the lens hood, so the hood being on always is pretty much how its gonna be. The lens hood makes the lens like 30-50% longer.

Ergonomics. Qs and Ms are sleek dawg. Not really anything to grab on to, thumb grip accessory is pretty much a must.

Lastly, start saving... because while the Q line does a lot of things very well... what it does best is make people want an M to pair with it. You cant fight it lol. My Q was actually my third Leica, so I was already too far gone... but like once a month around here someone who buys a Q ends up with an M lol.

I‚Äôve only used it briefly, but have a few thoughts: the images are stellar. It looks nice and seems to be built like a tank. But it‚Äôs heavy. The ergonomics are poor (for me). The features average and it‚Äôs got kind of sharp bits where you don‚Äôt want them and the joypad thing isn‚Äôt very nice, not for my big thumbs - crammed right against a screen that sticks up really proud.¬† There‚Äôs a grip case that was purchased with it - it‚Äôs not that comfy.

No idea how Leica could sell such an expensive case that‚Äôs so poorly designed and built. oh and the fotos app seemed really good, better than the new x app (which is far better than the previous Fuji camera remote app).

I can see Leica are well engineered but so are many other cameras. it‚Äôs also obviously marketed heavily playing on the ¬†‚ÄòLeica badge‚Äô desirability. Which brings us to the price - which is ridiculous.¬†

Maybe if I were to use it long term I‚Äôd grow to love it, but for me the x100 is a better choice for casual use.¬†It‚Äôs also ridiculously good value for money compared to Leica.

It‚Äôs good enough for most things and, come on - I love the creativity of a proper camera but unless we‚Äôre making a living from it it‚Äôs a luxury. And each newly made thing comes at an environmental cost. And none of the digital cameras will be working or current in 5-10 yrs time.¬†

lpbc9m9,Raptor470,"Had the Fuji X-E1, X-E2, X100 Classic & X100 V. I also had the Leica X1. Before all that Canon APS-C and 5D series.

After all that I was for a long time in the Sony APS-C (A6000 with and without Optical Image Stabilization \[OIS\] lenses) & full frame (A7ii & A7R3) game.

In the past the Ricoh GR series: GRD IV, GR(1), GR2. Now the GR3. Ricoh GR series is unbeatable - but don't expect low noise cameras in the high ISO range.

Now I own Leica M6 Classic film camera, Leica M digital cameras M11 & M10 Monochrom and Q3. 

- I hated the Fuji X-Trans sensors. No matter which RAW converter I used LR, C1 Pro and some various ones that promised a better handling, I ended up with a mush of pixels. I am not a heavy handed post-processing guy that do a heavy editing on the photos that it looks like it's been over-cooked. I experimented a lot of variables in the RAW converters and still I am missing the details that Bayer pattern sensors offers. The O.G. X100 Classic the only camera with the Bayer pattern sensor was top notch in delivering details.

You won't be disappointed with the image quality that the Q series delivers. A lot of details, beautiful rendering from the lenses and Leica's DNG RAW format are really easy handle and gives you a lot of latitude to do your editing in the RAW converters. Leica and Ricoh DNG RAW formats are the best in my opinion.   
Autofocus in the single drive mode and single point focus point is amazingly good. It can autofocus in the dark. That was surprisingly astonishing fact for me. 

- IBIS isn't relevant as the Q series got an OIS. The two camps: Either you prefer IBIS or OIS. Either way it helps a lot to get blur-free photos (camera shake) with that 60MP sensor. I have to take photos with a lot higher shutter speed on my M11 compared to a lower count megapixel sensor without an IBIS or OIS. 

- I'll keep the Q3 for a very long time. It is my companion to my M11. When the first Q was introduced I'd like the product, but there were some features missing and some issues I wasn't a fan of. The Q2 improved but still 2 issues I didn't like, with the Q3 everything is fine except a faster readout sensor would be better to avoid rolling shutter in electronic shutter mode - at least it the Q series has a mechanical leaf shutter with all its advantages like X100 series.

The reason I got the Q as a companion for my M6, M11 and M10 Monochrom is that I was fine to have the Voigtlander Ultron 28mm lens. I just was annoyed with the constant lens changing between 28mm & 50mm (also 35mm & longer lenses as 75mm & 90mm; depending on the assignment or the purpose). Besides that I was on Madeira Island off-road tour and hiking, the constant volcanic dust is really nasty. That's when I decided I need a weather-sealed camera with the same image quality as my M11. The OIS in the Q series a quite beneficial bonus that I am missing with the high pixel count sensor Leica M digital cameras. 

- What sucks? The Q series is not really compact, you will feel the weight or heft of the lens and the missing high readout sensor in electronic shutter mode. Everything else it is a perfect forever camera, if you need only one single camera and you commit yourself to only need one single focal length in your life.

Expect to buy a NAS to save and archive those large RAW files coming out of those 60MP sensors if you use the full potential of 60MP and not reducing it to the lower pixel count options.",1,1727513750.0,2024-09-28 08:55:50,,0,1fr9blu

Meanwhile, this new board might make M6 Classic repairs that require replacing the board possible for the first time since 2022, possibly for less than Leica will charge if they ever get round to it, and maybe more flexibly for independent technicians (I think recent Leica meter boards may only be adjustable with proprietary software that Leica keep to themselves; the original M6 classic boards just used potentiometers).",3,1727712852.0,2024-09-30 16:14:12,,0,1fqmxlt

Since then I've upgraded to the Q2 and I do not feel the need to switch up again to the Q3. When my kids were young I photographed their cute faces endlessly with mostly a portrait lens.

Looking back on the photos now, I wish I had used wide angle most of the time - because our vast album of family photos doesn't contain enough context - just portraits. My advice would be to stick with the Q3 you have purchased and record your family on its amazing 28mm lens. You can zoom or crop with so many megapixels if you need to.

If you don‚Äôt feel you‚Äôre getting any enjoyment or efficiency out of your current gear, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs time to make a change. Personally, I‚Äôd say its risky to sell everything you have and adopt a fixed-lens camera.

lp98gkt,cookedart,"I think for me personally, the Leica Q3 43 is less 'special' - because for almost all full frame systems, there are good 35 and 50mm fast lens options that are also relatively compact. Yes, the lens here will be awesome, and the overall package is great. But for me, the 28mm F/1.7 lens is unique and not as easily replicated on other systems.

Also, if you're considering from the perspective of owning only one camera to do it all, I think the Q3 does an amazing job being a 28mm camera, is still an amazing 35mm f/2, and a solid 50mm f/2.8 equivalent. That covers the most important every day focal lengths for me, while the Q3 43 covers mostly into the short telephoto range. It would be my go to camera if my main deal was environmental portraits, but as an everyday life companion style camera, the original Q3 is more flexible, in my opinion. The main crux is the 60mp sensor and very sharp lens let you crop very well into that sensor and gain tons of variety. For me, its almost as useful as a full frame camera with a 24-70mm zoom lens, for instance.",18,1727475978.0,2024-09-27 22:26:18,,0,1fqqqtm

lp3vj2l,bwehman,"Probably a conversation better suited for a beer and a hangout, but the short version is this: 

1. The seeds of the switch were planted when the RF mount and R5 came out, which basically obsoleted the EF glass inventory I built up that kept me in the Canon system for so long. Moving from EF to RF was basically equivalent to switching brands altogether, so I started to finally take a closer look at Leica.

2. I was feeling bored by Canon and the other mainstream systems that created photos that, IMO, were totally devoid of character. 

3. From a practical consideration, I was spending way too much editing time fighting CA and skin tones. The reviews of the APO lenses mentioned this being an improvement and in my experience it completely eradicated all those pain points entirely. 

4. This is the most petty but still a thing - I hated being ""out gunned"" by guests. Pretty commonly guests would (still do) roll up with the latest Sony or Canon and I felt like if I'm the only photographer being paid to take photos here, I (selfishly) want to have the best gear here, and almost feel like I was compelled to for the couple's sake. To be clear, this is petty and dumb and by no means a reason to switch on its own.

5. I'll end it with this, which is just that Leica and the way their entire system works made more sense to the way I approach gear. The menus are logical, the non-labeled and assignable buttons, the minimalist design, the robust build, the feel. All summed together, the things that nobody cares about other than me, the person using it all the time.",34,1727395679.0,2024-09-27 00:07:59,,0,1fqal02

lp4kg0k,barkingcat,"this is pretty much a non-truth these days.

In an advanced industrial process, the best way to make this would be using metal 3d printing. You can print whatever shape you want in however many units needed in deposited metals, and while the design of this hood won't give you automotive-capable strength (it's too thin), it would be absolutely fine for a lenshood, where the greatest stress would probably be face down crashing into the floor during a drop event (which is not all that much force).

Leica just refuses to modernize their methods even though ""advance manufacturing"" has passed them by. 

As a ""made in Germany"" company I'm really surprised they haven't already moved *all* their manufacturing to modern methods.

You can make custom 1-off rocket engines and turbine engine blades using 3d printed metals these days, and German companies are on the forefront of this type of metal working.",1,1727405079.0,2024-09-27 02:44:39,,0,1fq721s

So the Q puzzles me.  Sure, it should be usable in 10 years, but I am locked into a single lens choice forever.  Like I said, everyone should do what bakes their cookies, but it makes no sense to me to tie up that much capital for that degree of limited features.

Lens design is all about compromises, and Peter Karb really liked to talk about this style of design (for example, a variable aperture zoom is just a design where the aperture is not limited at the short end, whereas all the fixed aperture zooms are throwing away an extra f stop at the short side, so that fixed 2.8 24-70 really could be a variable f2 28 - f2.8 70) etc",4,1727377128.0,2024-09-26 18:58:48,,0,1fpwrhb

lpr843f,Individual_Job_9041,"
üì∏ I‚Äôve been testing this filter/hood thing for a few days now. Here‚Äôs all the intel below! üì∏

The eins Japan 1.2mm thick UV filter (thinnest filter in the market) is still too thick for the Q3 43 to activate macro mode while using the 43‚Äôs square hood. 

Currently, your only option to use the 43 square hood and a filter are with using an ultra slim filter (anything 3mm or thinner is confirmed, but possibly slightly thicker)‚Ä¶ and then slightly unscrew the hood (1 full rotation with the 1.2mm filter, likely full hood removal with anything thicker than 1.2mm) when you want to engage macro mode. 

Personally I‚Äôm opting for this minor but annoying extra step of 1 full hood rotation when I want macro mode. Why? Via Lightroom data, it appears I used macro for approximately 1% of all my photos on my old Q2 and Q3 28. So it‚Äôs not something I use that often. Secondly and most importantly, it‚Äôs for just a tiny bit of extra protection and insurance‚Ä¶ as this is my dedicated travel camera that goes along with me to some pretty gnarly environments. 

Certainly not ideal. But hey, those are the cards we‚Äôre dealt with. Your style of photography and type of places you travel to might not warrant the need for a filter at all. 
I would imagine a third party square hood would have to appear on the market to fix this issues. Or, based on my measurements, you could permanently modify your existing Leica 43 hood if you really want to get wild.

lp2ww43,FattyLumpkinIsMyPony,"KEH is not the company that they used to be. Sometime within the past 6-10 months they quietly changed their grading policy and many people are having issues with items in worse condition than advertised or items not functioning properly. I‚Äôm convinced they don‚Äôt even test the gear, only do a quick cosmetic look-over. 

In the past 4 months I have personally had to send back 2 cameras listed as excellent plus; one for cosmetic issues that should have been graded much lower, and one for a very obvious mechanical issue. If you do a search on r/AnalogCommunity for ‚ÄòKEH‚Äô you will see lots of other posts in this timeframe with similar problems, and many other commenters sharing their issues as well.

Luckily their customer service is still good and my issues were quickly and easily resolved. I decided I would not buy from KEH again for things over a few hundred dollars.

But if they find things that need repair or replacement, you definitly will pay for the extra work and materials and prices can go up A LOT more than 700 EUR.

lp0p2t1,sp3ct0r1640,"I just picked one up about a month ago. It seems fantastic. The aperture priority setting makes shooting much quicker for me. The only negative I can find is the light meter display is just not as good as the one in my M5. I don‚Äôt think any M body has an equivalent meter display to the M5. It really just gives you more control. 
One other negative - and some may not find it valid - is it just isn‚Äôt as smooth in action or satisfying in sound as the more mechanical M bodies. This is a rough comparison but the MA and MP are just so fantastic to hold and use and the motions and sounds are the best I have ever experienced in a camera. Is that fair, to compare a M7 to those camera bodies- probably not. 

I very much love my M7 and still think it was the right body for what I want. But I think for a mechanical purest (not me ) the M7 lacks that magic engagement.

loxn7cz,FroydReddit,"I won't comment on the price because I've not followed what Ms go for these days, but if this is your first Leica, I would suggest a different 50. Perhaps you should still go ahead with the purchase and then trade the Planar for something else. 

First the planar has 1/3 stop for the diaphragm. With a meterless camera, like the M4, all those extra stops make it harder to work quickly. The way I like to work with my M4 is to take a reading in the light a reading in the shadow,  memorize the two light values and then change aperture or shutter speed as I'm walking from one light environment to the other without having to look down and just by feel. With a typical three or four stop difference between light settings, it's easy to count three or four clicks on the shutter or clicks on the aperture ring and be ready to go by the time I'm in place to frame the shot. 1/3 stops make it harder to work this way. BUT, they're awesome for working with slides or with an aperture -priority camera.

The second issue I have with the planar as your first Leica lens Is that it does not have a proper tab. For my money, the most ergonomic lens design is that of the original 35 Summicron (except for the infinity lock!). Concave tabs are a real pleasure to use and really complement the RF shooting experience very well. If I were you I would look at a lens with a proper tab.",-4,1727305148.0,2024-09-25 22:59:08,,0,1fpg8go

loxz47b,DoctorLarrySportello,"I understand the sentiment about the focus tabs (I personally prefer concave tabs also), but I just received the 50mm Planar and I find the focusing to be very comfortable and practical to use. My last 50 was the Canon LTM 1.4, and I used the ring and sometimes a finger on the infinity lock, and it had a much longer focus throw making it slower and less comfortable to work rapidly; it never really ‚Äúgot in my way‚Äù, but I did have to get comfy with it. 

The Zeiss has a shorter throw, throws a lot faster compared to the Canon (my copy does at least; both are smooth but this one is quicker), and it‚Äôs an incredible performer for the price.

M4 on average is around $1400-2000 depending on details, market hype, etc., and the 50mm is usually around $400-600 on the used market depending on region and condition. 

Overall I think it‚Äôs a fair price for quality gear, but not a major deal to jump at.

If you want a Leica M and this combo suits your working style, aesthetic tastes, budget, and it‚Äôs said to be in good condition‚Ä¶ go for it :)",3,1727309518.0,2024-09-26 00:11:58,,0,1fpg8go

loy5zm2,DoctorLarrySportello,"Can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt comment on the rendering‚Ä¶ 

Yes, it has a great draw to it. At 2.0 just enough spherical aberrations/glow that one might benefit from it for ‚Äúsofter‚Äù focus in portraits (though there‚Äôs already a very impressive amount of detail & contrast), and then by 2.8 it corrects said aberrations and is significantly sharper. By 4.0 it seems to be ‚Äúperfect‚Äù by all accounts, unless you pair it side by side with something like the APO lenses‚Ä¶. But still it would be hard to see the difference imo.

lp1bs2o,DoctorLarrySportello,"Hey sure thing:

Yes I develop all of my B&W films; 35mm, 120, 4x5, and 8x10. It‚Äôs cheaper and lets you have final control of your tonality and grain characteristics. 

I almost exclusively shoot Foma 200 in 35mm now as my daily B&W film. I rate it at 125ASA, and develop usually in Fomadon Excel (copy of Kodak‚Äôs XTOL developer) at 1:1 dilution. I sometimes also shoot Foma 100 in 35mm (rated at 64ASA) and also develop in Excel 1:1. 

I switch to Rodinal if I‚Äôm shooting Foma 100 in 4x5, as the larger surface area already minimizes grain, and I feel the clarity and acutance offered by Rodinal works very well with the classic grain of the 100 film. My standard dilution is usually 1:49. I dislike Rodinal on Foma 200 because of how it renders the hybrid grain in midtones; it gets to be a little too coarse for my tastes, and so I go back to Excel when shooting Foma 200 in 4x5. 

Personally I never really push film for my work, but I have done tests with both films and they‚Äôre both flexible enough in the right developer/dilution. If I needed to push for a certain project, I think I‚Äôd work with Foma 200 & Excel stock, or give DDX a try if I needed to really go further than 1 or so stops.

I love my Q3 for lots of things, but it doesn't always do it for me so I have other systems for long distance, faster subjects (my dogs.)  I think the more important question is what need or void is the camera going to fill, or what void will having that camera create. For me, the Q filled a portable and easy to use solution (I can pass it to my wife and she's not intimidated) but I still have a robust system in the SL lineup to get the reach without cropping, and an old school M for when I just want to feel like a ""real photographer."" I contemplate selling one or other all the time when I feel weighed down. But ultimately never do because they each have their purpose.

But if that doesn‚Äôt work, one thing I can say is the minolta CLE has the best 28 viewfinder I‚Äôve shot with. It‚Äôs perfect‚Äîthe camera is just made for 28. It‚Äôs not a perfect camera and has a few other warts, but for just 28, it‚Äôs really something. The electronics gave out on mine after 4 or 5 years as a daily carry, and I still miss it.

lotvncd,lottic,"The bubbling effect on black and silver chrome Leica M6 cameras does not affect its ability to function; but just appears.... unique.

The bubbling observed on the original Leica M6 cameras (including classic and TTL); excluding the 2022 reissue and any black paint models: feature zinc top plates that are coated with layers of nickel and chrome. This construction choice kept the camera lightweight and reasonably wear resistant (i.e zinc is more resistant to denting than brass),  but was sensitive to the environment... 

1. Zinc Oxidation. Zinc is a reactive metal, and when the protective chrome or nickel coating is compromised‚Äîsuch as through scratches or prolonged exposure to moisture ‚Äî oxidation can occur. This oxidation process causes the zinc to turn into a white powder, which can lift the plating and create bubbles on the camera's surface.

2. Galvanic Corrosion. If the zinc is exposed to salty environments, such as sea spray or sweat, a galvanic reaction can occur. This reaction accelerates corrosion and the bubbling effect.

3. Storage Conditions. Storing the camera in humid conditions or in certain types of leather cases can exacerbate these issues. The interaction between zinc and chemicals in some case materials may contribute to the bubbling problem; particularly leather which tends to retain moisture in its own right.",5,1727257053.0,2024-09-25 09:37:33,,0,1fou5wx

The meter for the mp/reissue can't be used on the classic cameras as it is completely different from both the ttl and classic. It requires proprietary Leica software to tune the meter and does not have potentiometers like the older cameras. The mp meter is based on the m6 ttl but obviously has the ttl flash removed.

In terms of the hybrid viewfinder - I have a real love of my x100v and the hybrid view is one of the reasons. I can (and often do) flick between them in most sessions with a flick of the switch. Just depends what I‚Äôm doing, both have pros and cons, so having both in the same space is incredible. A diopter too!

Having the option of a 0.58x or a 0.85x would appease a lot of people for sure. however the production complications and bifurcating the market would have larger implications that outsiders likely couldn't understand. 

Personally... I think if they just keep the 0.72x finder, but MAKE IT BIGGER, it would solve some problems. The viewfinder eye hole is unnecessarily small. I would take a camera body that was a full centimeter taller to allow for a larger finder. 

When i tried my first M I was astounded by the poor VF experience. This was coming from an XPro2, where the optical finder was much better for seeing outside the frame lines so you can compose and wait for the right moment to snap.",20,1727183047.0,2024-09-24 13:04:07,,0,1fo8vsp

The Zf is a fantastic camera, but it takes a while to get used to.
It's also incredibly heavy, almost certainly needs a grip added, and will need 1-2 spare batteries for an event. 
The Z lenses are very much the same weight, if not a lot bigger/heavier than the F lenses (50/1.8 S vs 50/1.4G, or 85/1.8S vs 85/1.4G.. completely ignoring the 1.2 versions here, since they are just ridiculously huge)

In the end, the Zf might put just as much strain on your back as the D810 does, while being less ergonomic to work with for long events.

I'm definitely not in any rush to purchase a kit, so I'll probably just keep enjoying the ol' d810 for a bit longer and let the prices on mirrorless continue to dip.

  
It might make more sense to keep the F mount kit for general photography, and get something more landscape-specialized for ultralight backpacking trips. The Ricoh GR was pleasant, but I'm spoiled with FF image quality, and won't go back. If that's the case, a Sigma FP L with the sigma 28-70 would be lighter weight than my d810 body alone. Or there's always the jump up in image quality to a medium format camera a-la Hasselblad x1dii... Lots to chew on, but it's pretty awesome to live in a time with all of these amazing camera systems.

  
You're not wrong about working out! That's the best option to covering more ground in the mountains. I have found though, that shaving \~8lbs off my backpacking gear, made a huge difference on 20 mile days. The shedding of that much pack weight made me want to do more photography, and setup more shots off-trail.

* Exposure triangle and composition/focus are all I want to deal with in the field.
* I don't chimp or use a screen on my other cameras while doing my work, so its absence shouldn't affect my workflow.
* I love the serendipity  of ""developing"" my images in Lightroom and seeing them for the first time in that moment.
* I'm *extremely* left-eye dominant and that means nose prints all over my cameras with a screen.
* I try to find the lightest-weight, smallest kit possible, so shaving off a touch by not having a screen is useful to me on my adventures.
* I can use my iPhones text scaling feature to adjust the FOTOS interface to mirror my preferences (i.e., make the text bigger for my aging eyes).
* I have a Q2 that will come with me when I think a screen, AF, or something else it offers that the M11-D doesn't will be of value. (I think this is hugely important, OP. Do you have another camera that can fill in the gaps when necessary?)
* I don't have to worry about a screen getting scratched, dated, or malfunctioning. (This is less of a concern with modern cameras, but I thought I'd list it.)
* Plain old nostalgia! I grew up shooting and developing film. The M11-D is the hybrid experience I want.

At the end of the day, it's about a tool in your toolbox. It will be the right tool for some of us, not so much for most.

Let us know what you decide!

With those cameras, which communicate with the flash for TTL metering etc., I think you just need to half-press the shutter button to wake the flash. But the other M6 variants (Classic or 2022) and the MP just have basic single contact X-sync hotshoes like an M4-2. All they can do is trigger the flash if it's on and awake. Flash technology has regressed to the 1970s level in current Leica film cameras. You might be better off with a less sophisticated third party flash on the M6. Otherwise, the easiest way to wake it is probably to press the + or - button, but an occasional failure to recharge could indicate a fault - are the batteries fresh?",2,1727199547.0,2024-09-24 17:39:07,,0,1fofhkf

I personally did what another person suggested and bought a 0.58x viewfinder M6. It is an incredible camera and means I can use a 28mm with little to no issues. 

That being said... you can always get an external finder to use them. External finders are often much much better overall. Bigger, brighter, and more practical for street work. I use one for my 21mm, which is excellent. 

The viewfinders on M bodies are, to me at least, the biggest issue and one that has always surprised me that Leica has not made more improvements. I don't care about 60mp sensors...

When I am out with a 50 or 90 it's a different story (again personally not a general statement) - I usually take my time to line things up better in the frame, so it's a different style of shooting.

lokbs1f,IntrepidTraveller6,"Yes an external optical viewfinder. There aren't many that zoom... and with a RF you're only really going to be using prime lenses anyway. 

If you want precise framing then a rangefinder isn't the right camera. You will want an SLR - in particular one with 100% viewfinder coverage. Most will have 90-95% coverage. The Nikon F with HP finder is a good option to look at. 

Rangefinders are great for being compact and very quick (when used a certain way). 

Standard VF with Leica is 0.72x. In this the 35mm frame lines will be on the edge and those that wear glasses will have issues. 

They did offer special options for a time that included 0.58x or 0.85x. My 0.58x finder is excellent for 35mm focal length and good enough for 28mm. Also good for 50mm... but longer than that is not ideal. A 0.85x finder is apparently good for 50mm and longer (I haven't tried one before). These special finders are only found on analog M bodies - not digital. 

For digital it is 0.72x only. So if you want digital then you will need to deal with this finder magnification... or you can look at the SL or Q series cameras instead.",5,1727115878.0,2024-09-23 18:24:38,,0,1fnpep3

The one caution with a cloth shutter is to not leave the lens uncovered in bright sun.  Cloth shutters can literally have a hole burned in them when the lens is at full aperture and in strong sunlight.

See if you can put a deposit on it and run a roll of film through it in the store.  This will let you see if there are any severe shutter issues.

lof485t,armevans,"The lens doesn‚Äôt look to be in great shape. Probably worth a few hundred dollars at least on eBay, but tough to get those lenses back in good condition once the front element is damaged, and they damage very easily. The meter and case are worth a bit too, assuming they‚Äôre in good shape.

The body appears to be in decent condition, and a clear viewfinder and functioning rangefinder is a good sign. Were able to cock the shutter and try a few different speeds?

Even if the camera needs a CLA (figure $3-400 for YYe to do it), I think it‚Äôs a decent deal. Not a once in a lifetime deal, but you‚Äôre basically getting the lens, meter, and case thrown in for the price of a beater body.

Then you have the meter and the glass here, the glass isn‚Äôt in the best of shape, but still a couple hundred at least. The meters go for around 27 bucks non working and more for working.

loj8ynd,bwehman,"Of all the common places, B&H > KEH > Adorama. Based on buying over $100K worth of gear between the three of them over the last decade, here's my reasoning:

Adorama: used to be a fav but they've gotten really weird about returns lately. I definitely haven't had many returns with them over the last 10+ years, but this last one I did a month ago was a bit odd. They basically made the default return option just getting back store credit, and to request a refund on the OG payment method is a bit of an ordeal. Nit picky and niche, but all of these are so neck and neck, any bit of friction is a big bummer. 

KEH: Love them, never an issue, but their prices are a bit above market in my experience for used gear. They have probably the best selection though, so if you can't find it at either B&H or Adorama, it's probably at KEH.

B&H: The GOAT. They're just as good as KEH in terms of used ratings, their customer service slays Adorama, but the real win is that credit card. Either spreading out payments if you're tight on cash but need a big purchase, or of course, instantly saving about 10% by not having to pay sales tax.

With that out of the way, the -D models are meant to mimic a film-like shooting experience. No one needs to like that but to that end, it's not as if you can change iso mid-roll on a film camera. Would I have removed the iso knob? Nope. But I understand it as leaning into the film-like experience. If you handed me any digital M I'd set it to auto ISO and never touch another button (I'd adjust the shutter dial) so a -D would be fine.

lohe9q9,jrhodespianist,"As someone who has and loves the M11-D I understand your frustration but ultimately disagree. The freezing is, as has been said, inexcusable. I had to sell 3 different M11 variants in the past due to this issue and it is insane that it is still happening. I am so sorry that affected you. But regarding the D itself, I initially set my camera up the way I like it (NR off, DNG only, multi metering, hybrid shutter, single shot, storage options etc etc, the basics that took me all off three minutes) and haven¬¥t changed any setting since save for ISO, exposure compensation, shutter speed and focal length all of which, obviously, are done on the camera. The app is now largely redundant for me and I have turned off the connection (also done via the camera), although if traveling I will have it connected for geotagging.

There are a surprising number of things you can actually change using the just camera through function button presses, rear button presses and different length of presses etc.

I find it is a reliable, brilliant camera. Cost aside (everyone will have an opinion), it is perfect for me and I cannot agree with your position that the camera relies on the app too much. In my experience that is simply not true. I think for people who are constantly changing from 60 to 36 or 18mp, or from single shot to burst mode then yes, that could be slightly frustrating. Although even so, presumably this would be before a shoot and it takes all of one minute to open the app, change those settings and then forget it. I would say that if you are looking for a camera whose setting you want to have to hand easily because you change them multiple times per shoot, then the P is a much better choice than the D.

My one complaint is the lack of formatting. But my guy at Leica says they are aware of that and working on a solution. For now I simply delete the photos from the SD card after import on my Mac and it¬¥s done.

Overall I¬¥m very happy with it. The colours also seem better, but maybe that¬¥s just me (my old M11-P had penultimate firmare and this one has the latest).",3,1727068624.0,2024-09-23 05:17:04,,0,1fmsqlx

When shooting photographs, you need to adjust aperture, shutter speed, and iso. OK, maybe a bonus one: EV. All of the aforementioned can be adjusted from camera without the use of the app. There's a shutter speed dial, there's an iso dial on the back, the aperture is on the lens, and the EV you set one of the two or three extra 'function' buttons for it. The freezing is an obvious issue and agree with you on that.

lodxdu0,ecpwll,"I've studied and done tests on this more or less extensively. I'm not sure why, but it seems no digital photo camera has any latitude whatsoever in the highlights.  If you shoot a color chart the whites will start clipping with just one or two stops over exposure.  The dynamic range is there though, it is just *all in the shadows*.  So while the M11 does have another stop or two of DR, you can only take advantage of it by underexposing.

Basically, the problem is that for some reason on photo cameras the distribution of dynamic range is bad, it is all in shadows no highlights.  This is in contrast to cinema cameras (I work in film as a colorist) which generally have a very even distribution of dynamic range betweeb shadows to highlights.  The difference is extremely obvious if you compare color charts between the two as I have, in the highlights the photo camera clips immediately while the cinema camera keeps on going.  And while I haven't tested this properly, I am fairly certain this happens even when the photo camera has the same sensor (ie the Sony A9 and the Venice ).

So basically, what that means is that while the dynamic range is there, you can only take advantage of it by underexposing. On a lot photo cameras that is a problem that will result in ugly noise after a few stops, but on the M11 you can underexpose 5 stops even and still have a great image, so I just shoot highlight priority mode and that generally works great.  It definitely should be fixable in camera with just software though without having to underexpose, although no sure how much Lightroom etc. may have to do with the problem as well.",8,1727023769.0,2024-09-22 16:49:29,,0,1fmsqlx

I think the in the future the M10p will be seen as the ultimate digital M. It does everything I could want and nothing extra to detract from the experience. And it feels like my m7/3. And it works like them.

I think the M11 sensor is too high a resolution for both the entirety of the Leica catalog of lenses and  for rangefinder focusing. With film there is a lot of wiggle room on focus due to the lower resolution. In the m10p there is some, on the m10r/m there is less, but on the m11 I think focus tolerance is so low, that I started missing focus pretty frequently, across two bodies, with the 35fle that I use the most frequently fine on other bodies.

loztrnz,Wild_Beautiful_2133,"Since the Q cameras came out I always tought how I would love to have a 35mm or 50mm instead. That always felt like the dream camera for me.

When looking through my Lightroom library I saw that \~80% of my images are shot with a 43mm lens (I shoot with a GFX and mostly using the GF 55mm). So when news came out that a Leica Q43mm was going to be released I was very excited.

I borrowed a Leica Q (type 116) from a friend for a day last week and walked around to see how I feel about that 28mm. Given that I would never walk around with a camera with a wide lens like that, I was curious to how it would feel. And here comes the important bit: though most of my work is actually shot in that 40/50mm area the rest of it is around 24-35mm and only very rarely I would use a long lens (like a 110mm).

To my surprise it was not a problem at all to adapt to it. Any other camera with enough resolution could do it as well but they all lack the framelines that help you to frame your shot.

Even with the resolution of the Q I was more than happy to crop to 35mm and the files looked impressive AND it was so fun to use that camera. I am looking for a smaller camera that can be my everyday carry around but also capable of giving me high quality images for when I need it. Given the Q's resolution and that the Q3 has \~3x as many pixels to work with, I got now more sold on the Q3 instead of the new Q43. The Q3 will still have plenty of resolution to work with cropped down to their 50mm fov. So one camera would cover almost 95% of the focal length that I usually use.

With the Q43 I was already thinking how I would probably carry with me a Ricoh GRIII for anything wide and that is what felt odd to accept. In my pursuit of having a everyday camera I was thinking of adding two cameras to walk around with.

  
To make things short:

if you think you would sometimes need a wide lens for what you shoot, I would go with the Q3. That way you would be covered for everything. If you would generally not have a need for anything wider than 35mm, I would go with the new Q43 and just step an extra step back for whenever you need more in frame and otherwise you would have a great companion with you.",2,1727343546.0,2024-09-26 09:39:06,,0,1fmza3o

43mm is better for this.  
  
Kind of a tough question. I own a Q2M and I absolutely love it. I come from being somewhat of a gear-head who took a lot of stuff when I had the opportunity to shoot. For instance, I would go on a hike (like light climbing and stuff) and I would take a backpack with a Canon EOS R with three L-series lenses (RF 15-35, 28-70, and 70-200). I wanted to be ready for ANYTHING. And it‚Ä¶ kinda sucked. I mean, sure, I got a lot of ‚Äúgood‚Äù pictures but carrying all that weight every single time was not that great. Then I got a Fujifilm X100V and realized it‚Äôs not -so much- about the focal length, but about having fun with it. I went to Italy last year and that‚Äôs the only camera I took with me. Then, while in Milan, I found the Leica store and impulse-bought the Q2M. I just can‚Äôt put it down.  
  
I can‚Äôt say for sure you would experience the same as I did, but regardless of which one you choose, you would end up ‚Äúmissing out‚Äù on the other. There will be situations, WITH EITHER ONE, where you‚Äôll think ‚Äúman, I wish I had <the other one> right now‚Äù, and you‚Äôll still make the best of the situation with what you have.

Do not listen to anyone that states the M5 is ‚Äúodd.‚Äù  The reality is that it is a no compromise camera that still is incredibly advanced for a film camera, primarily for its build construction and its through the lens meter pivot arm.

Be careful with lenses with deep rear elements!

From 35mmc:

this light meter arm is the reason some lenses with deep-recessing rear elements just don‚Äôt fit the Leica M5. Later Leicas solve this problem by the cameras meter taking a reflected reading off a patch on the shutter curtain. This later approach not only allows the use of more lenses, but is also mechanically much more simple.

The simplicity of the later Leicas is definitely an advantage to them, but its hard not to acknowledge the mechanical wonder that is the metering arm of the Leica M5. When no lens is attached to the M5 there is no sign of the metering arm, it hides itself away in the lower part of the camera. As a lens is attached part of the bayonet lens mount pushes a small button in the mount of the camera which raises the meter arm into position behind the lens. Pushing the shutter button then lowers the arm out of the way for the photo to be taken before the shutter fires. Of course this means far more parts to potentially break or damage, but it‚Äôs impressive nonetheless.

After many years with all sorts of gear, i sold everything and bought an M10r with a 50mm Summicron f/2. For now, all im thinking about getting is a 28mm Elmarit f/2.8 and call it a day. That will give me some closer landscapes, street photography and the occasional portrait/family scene. It wont do everything, but it will cover 80% of what i need.

I always think i do want to add something else to this setup, like a weather sealed body and weather sealed lens like an SL2-S with maybe an APO SL lens and an M adapter, for maximum flexibility. But the weight deters me. I considered Sigma Lenses which are great and lighter. Autofocus could be nice in certain scenarios, since i have kids that play sports and live where wildlife photography could be interesting. Was also thinking of a Sony a6700 for maximum portability.  

But i absolutely adore the flexibility of having just a small M body wirh max 2 M lenses. Camera in hand and one lens in the coat pocket. Maybe an extra battery in the other pocket lol

I‚Äôve found the M to be great for photography focused trips. It is a joy to use and once you learn a few tricks the focus is fairly easy to get the hang of and things start to click. The ability to travel with 35/50/90 in such a small package is great and the resolution means you can crop a ton which adds to the versatility. If I didn‚Äôt have kids and was going to travel the world this is the kit I would take.  The visoflex is a miss as it takes away the ability to use flash.  The current 35 lux is my favorite and pretty much lives on the camera. Overall it is a great system. 

The SL3 is really the most versatile of their lineup. If you want to get into automotive photography it may be a better setup. You can take m lenses when you want to be super (almost m) small, sigma lenses when you want autofocus and small size and Leica L mount glass (35/59/75) if you want ridiculous image quality.  It has the added benefit of sharing the same battery as your Q but it is still the biggest and heaviest option. 

As to other brands, I have an X2D and it is slow compared to the Q3. It is a great camera but the X1DII is even slower.  The Sony I have used and it feels like a computer that happens to take pictures. No soul at all.  If I were in your shoes I would also take a hard look at the Nikon ZF. There is an adapter for it that will autofocus M lenses and the 40mm kit lens gets good reviews.

loqit2g,home_abroad,"I've had this happen on a Voigtlander lens where it locked on other M bodies but not my film body.

You'll see a small cutout that the mechanism engages . . .if you have the lens off and press the release button a few times, you can see the part on the camera body that engages moving so you know what it's trying to do. . . the part on the lens flange that's probably the issue is in the shape of a ""U"".  I took the end of fingernail clippers. the little ones that have the file and pointed tip for going under your nails, and ran that along the edge of the ""U"" shape and there was a small piece of metal. . . basically a metal burr that didn't get cleaned off good when manufactured and it kept it from engaging.

lohw29s,DigitalHeMan,"I think you need to consider how you want to use the camera/lenses. If you want to be able to shoot with both 35 and 50 in the same day, then maybe it makes sense to go for the additional lens, rather than carrying a separate camera body. However, some may say having two separate cameras with two separate focal lengths, provide you with a lot more flexibility, or be it with additional weight to carry. 

A third option to consider would be to buy a 35mm M lens (plenty of choice, but for the money you are talking about you could buy a summilux), and the appropriate adapter. You would need to be comfortable with using manual focus, however, that‚Äôs easy with the SL, and the additional weight is going to be almost nothing. In fact, you may like the experience so much that you end up buying a whole cupboard full of M lenses üòÄ

In terms of which is the better buy, if you consider better buy to mean better investment, then I always feel lenses are a better investment as camera bodies/cameras, ie the Q2, tend to lose their value faster than a good quality camera lens due to technology obsolescence.",2,1727080565.0,2024-09-23 08:36:05,,0,1fn9njr

Upgrades from IIf to IIIf were straightforward - the IIf already had a rangefinder, and the slow speed dial was easy to add as the body shell was drilled for it with a blanking plate to plug the hole. But it's possible yours was a IIIf all along. The public serial number lists aren't always completely accurate, and at least one original IIIf has been reported in the [IIf 762001-765000 range](https://wiki.l-camera-forum.com/leica-wiki.en/index.php/Leica_IIf). If you are interested in the history, you may be able to find this out from Leica, who are nice about answering queries from their achive. They often know the date a camera was originally shipped and its destination city, too. For more information, contact:

info at leica-camera.com

If you haven't used a screwmount Leica before, it's really worth reading the excellent manual, especially the stuff about loading the camera starting on p27:

[https://www.cameramanuals.org/leica\_pdf/leica\_if\_iif\_iiif.pdf](https://www.cameramanuals.org/leica_pdf/leica_if_iif_iiif.pdf)

You probably know this already, but it's important to trim the film leader to the profile shown on p29, with a longer narrow section than is standard today, to avoid loading problems and jams that can create film chips that get into the mechanism. There are cutting templates for this you can use with a sharp knife (the vintage ABLON is expensive, but there are cheap modern alternatives on ebay etc.). I just use a small pair of scissors, taking care to cut between and not across sprocket holes, leaving about 23 'unpaired' and undamaged, and rounding off the corner. If you prepare a few films like this before you go out, you can reload the camera surprisingly quickly.",2,1727016914.0,2024-09-22 14:55:14,,0,1fmm4ws

Also, mirroring what others said, remove the old glue with acetone before putting anything new.

There are also casting marks to the sides of the door that were filled during manufacturing; most likely you can put the new skin without any issues but I felt really nervous that the new skin would feel uneven with those casting marks being hollow or that trapped air would loosen the new glue.

For that I removed the previous paste and filled it with bondo (the type of paste they use for car bodywork) and sanded it with 250->500->1500 grit sand paper.

It‚Äôs a mechanical system where the tolerances have to be very tight to make it accurate. My newer leica lenses are all spot on and most of my newer voigtlanders are too. My vintage ones, some are okay, some aren‚Äôt close. I have an MS optics that is atrocious but it is what it is. If it‚Äôs LTM lenses then adapter thickness plays a major role. 

You can‚Äôt calibrate multiple things. I generally will adjust to a 50mm lens and one I know is right at infinity. This can easily be checked by taking the lens to infinity and checking with the screen that it is in fact focused to infinity and not past or short. If it‚Äôs at infinity then adjust the rangefinder so that it matches. If the lens is properly calibrated it should now be on at 5m, 2m and 0.7m (compare screen to rangefinder) if those checks all pass then the camera is calibrated and any lens that doesn‚Äôt match up is an issue with the lens itself.

lo7aumt,GammaDeltaTheta,"The widest framelines on the M3, 50mm, are a bit of a limitation. You'd need to guesstimate or use an accessory finder for anything wider. So a lens that would work well on both would be a 50mm Summicron or Summilux of any generation, depending on taste and budget. I have the older E43 Summilux and wouldn't be parted from it, but there are other lenses that test (and may suit your taste) better, including the contemporary Summicron, and excellent alternatives from Zeiss and Voigtl√§nder (the APO-Lanthar is competitive with Leica's own APO lens, for a fraction of the price, though it's rather large).

But it looks like you already have a lens for the M3, a vintage collapsible 50? If so, it may be time to think of supplementing it with something wider, especially for landscape and street. Some people like to go straight to 28mm to maximise the difference with a 50mm, but for me a 35mm is already quite a different lens and arguably the most versatile overall. Mine happens to be a Summicron ASPH v1, which has excellent performance and tends to be relatively well priced by Leica standards, but there are many other great options (its non-ASPH predecessor has something of a cult following). You might find yourself using the 35mm mostly on the M6 and the 50mm on the M3, especially as the M6 has somewhat undersized framelines for 50mm at longer distances. But there will probably be situations where you'd want to swap lenses, like when you want to use a different film to the one you have loaded. If you're not happy with guesstimating (the M3 finder outside the framelines is very roughly equivalent to 35mm), invest in an accessory viewfinder. The vintage Leica SBLOO is superb, and Voigtl√§nder made an excellent (and smaller) alternative, also in metal with brightlines, more recently.",4,1726924242.0,2024-09-21 13:10:42,,0,1flzdhh

lo31xth,theBitterFig,"Here's what I'd love about it: 43/2 is going to be closer to the Konica Auto S2's 45/1.7 that I shot with in High School and college. It used to be my Mum's from new. I think there's something special about the fast-50 (ish) look, and a compact with a fast-50 is just going to smoke anything else in terms of shallow DOF. If there was a built in flash and ND like in an x100? Oh lordy that'd be a portrait beast of a Compact.

Also, I'm just more of a 50mm shooter. My Pentax typically has a 50/1.4 (just got the DFA\*), my Fuji a 35/2.

Granted, I can't afford a Leica, so it's all academic to me. But just for myself, I'd much rather a 43 or 45 over a 28 or 35.

lo8c607,frankchn,"> Leica likes to think they‚Äôre a professional tool. Hermes never claims you can use their bags on a construction site.

I think they shifted their marketing in recent years to being more about the luxury. Looking at their site, the tag lines for the M11-D is ""digital heart, analogue soul"" and for the M-P it is ""mechanical perfection"". I don't really see much mention of professional usage any more.

> All itlll take is for a major player to release a full fledged digital range finder less than $3k and it‚Äôs bye bye Leica.

I don't think that would do anything to Leica either. 

Even in the non-rangefinder markets where you expect other manufacturers to do better due to the lack of ""heritage"", Leica keeps making and selling Q3s (which are still hard to find -- [The Economist even wrote an article about this recently](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/09/12/demand-for-high-end-cameras-is-soaring)), while Sony [discontinued their direct competitor](https://www.sonyalpharumors.com/end-of-an-era-sony-r1xrii-officially-discontinued/) (RX1R II). The Q3 is also almost twice the price of the RX1R II, so it is not like Leica is cheap in this instance either.

I think in general you have to analyze Leica as a luxury brand (whatever their marketing might say). Hermes Birkin enthusiasts will only buy genuine Hermes bags even if there are reps available for 1/100th the price, and Leica aficionados will only buy Leica even if Canikony comes out with cheaper or better (or both!) cameras.",2,1726937128.0,2024-09-21 16:45:28,,0,1fl93xx

lo029si,wholemilklatte,"I think it has less to do with field of view than it does the field compression. We have peripheral vision in our field of view that appears to us like a very wide angle view (because it is), but the relationship between objects that are near to us and far from us is different from what is represented in a wide-angle lens field of view - such as a 28mm 

50mm (and i guess maybe more accurately 43mm per one of the comments above) does the best job of representing the relationship between near and far objects within the human field of view. It's all very interesting to me.

What's not so interesting (again - to me) is the idea of having multiple fixed lens focal length cameras. Soon we'll have a Q3 28, Q3 43, Q3 90? I can see why but if this is real i feel like this is what steers Q users towards M???",25,1726805004.0,2024-09-20 04:03:24,,0,1fl2ebx

I have a 20mm lens for micro four thirds which is a 40mm full frame equivalent. I work outside a decent amount so I kept that focal length in mind and noticed that 40mm is definitely more in line with what I see. I was originally thinking it was 28mm because I was factoring in our peripheral vision but after really opening my eyes (so to speak) I noticed that yes, ~40mm is definitely close to what my eyes are focused on when I take out my peripheral vision. So now it makes more sense why they chose 43mm and yeah I dig it for sure.",1,1726864522.0,2024-09-20 20:35:22,,0,1fl2ebx
lo4afxh,DayTraditional2846,"Well for most of the day after seeing this and reading other people‚Äôs comments on why Leica chose 43mm made me be mindful of what focal length we see when we take out our peripheral vision into account. I definitely saw it more in line with 40mm since I have a lens that‚Äôs that focal length on a different system. My personal favorite focal length is 35mm which I can visualize without any effort due to how long I‚Äôve used it so 40mm or 43mm took a lot of getting used to. Especially since it‚Äôs in between my two most used focal lengths (35mm and 50mm M mount lenses). 

I guess 43mm is quite close so yeah I can see why they went with it. But can‚Äôt help but think they didn‚Äôt make a 35mm version due to that potentially cutting into sales of their most popular focal length on M mount next to the 50mm. If they had made a 35mm version I would definitely have sold my M10, SL, and S1R for it. That would leave me with a Q3 (35mm version) and my M10M.

I also mostly connect it for the geotagging, but because it's so new I've been playing around a bit with what I find good settings (still not sure which metering mode I want to keep it on, and still not entirely sure if I want to keep it on AWB or not - on my M11-P I set white balance manually but that's more complicated with the D of course, so thinking either leaving it on Daylight or AWB - the main issue I have with AWB is that when I load my photos on the computer they all are slightly different, whereas with a fixed setting they are all the matching - even though daylight is not always the correct choice). But once I figure out my preferences I intend to just set it and forget it.

It's funny that while it's basically the same camera as the M11-P, it is still very different in how you end up using it.",1,1726840021.0,2024-09-20 13:47:01,,0,1fl843i

But in general the M11's battery has been excellent, especially compared to the M10's. I often grab my camera without thinking about the current battery charge level, but if I know I'm going on a longer trip I'll definitely prepare a charge of course. I do think that if you are a reporter in the field shooting every day 5 days feels like a big stretch to me.. I've never tried it though.

lo41z1i,armevans,"Either camera is realistically going to be fine‚Äîmore than fine‚Äîfor relearning photography. Both take excellent photos in skilled hands. Like a good many folks on this forum, I came to Leica from Fuji, so I can speak a bit to both systems generally if you have questions (though I haven‚Äôt owned either of the specific models you‚Äôre looking at).

One thing worth noting, particularly as you highlighted getting into photography and then setting it aside for a while in the past, is that Fuji is currently super hyped. Even older models are selling for way more than they used to on the preowned market, and new cameras are priced at a premium and still selling out. Perhaps that will continue, perhaps not, but at least looking backwards, you‚Äôre currently paying inflated prices for most Fujifilm cameras, particularly those in the X100 or XPro series.

In contrast, the original Q is also the subject of some hype but is about as affordable now as it‚Äôs ever previously been. Leicas tend to depreciate relatively slowly, so unlike the Fuji, you aren‚Äôt likely to see big valuation swings in either direction.

Of course, all that only matters if you‚Äôre likely to sell or trade your camera at some point. 

In terms of features for the two cameras you‚Äôve cited, I‚Äôd prefer the original Q. Film simulations aren‚Äôt a big priority for me, and 24mp is fine for my purposes. The lens on the Q is a spectacular performer, and the full frame sensor is also a significant advantage. I‚Äôm sure people will be divided on 28mm vs. 35mm (equivalent) for day-to-day shooting, but I tend to prefer the wider view, especially with a fast and close-focusing lens. There are certainly cases where the Q would be preferable (video being one huge one), but I‚Äôm figuring you wouldn‚Äôt be considering the Q at all if it didn‚Äôt fit your use case.

All that said, it probably is worth noting that both of these cameras are overkill for the scenario you‚Äôve described‚Äîno one *needs* a Leica or a very hyped Fuji for family snapshots or a community college photo class. Any mirrorless camera or DSLR would do the trick just fine, and plenty of photographers have done much more with much less. That‚Äôs not a reason not to buy the camera you want (if people didn‚Äôt buy fancier cameras than they need, the Leica sub would be much, much smaller), but if you‚Äôre budget-conscious, there are a lot of other options out there worth considering.

lnvf5ak,Blairsugarman1,"For Leica lenses the main thing to look at are the abbreviations that come before and after the lens names as they are the main deciders for quality and price. You can have a ‚Äòfaster‚Äô lens like a Summilux that has a wider aperture of F1.4, but it can be cheaper than a ‚Äòslower‚Äô F2 lens if it isn‚Äôt apochromatic (see below). 

Lens speed refers to the maximum aperture (lowest F number), with lenses with wide apertures being referred to as ‚Äòfast‚Äô because they can achieve the same exposure as average lenses with a faster shutter speed. So, rather than shooting at F4 on 1/60s, you can shoot on F2 at 1/125 and maintain the same level of exposure. The shutter speed is the thing that‚Äôs faster. 

Things to be wary of when choosing Leica lenses:

ASPH - Aspherical - Lenses that use aspherical elements to reduce astigmatism and spherical aberrations, producing a much sharper picture.

APO - Apochromatic - Lenses that are corrected to ensure that all colours converge on the same focal point, reducing chromatic aberration or color fringing.  

An APO Summicron (F2) ASPH can be more expensive than a non-APO Summilux, even if the Lux is faster.",17,1726739209.0,2024-09-19 09:46:49,,0,1fkgojd

lnwbq5b,GammaDeltaTheta,">My problem is that the videos I‚Äôm watching don‚Äôt exactly explain what the differences in function are between them. Is having that additional f-stop on the Summilux a straight upgrade or does it come with its drawbacks even when just using f2.0 on it?

Every lens design is a compromise. A Summilux will be larger, heavier and more expensive than an equivalent Summicron of the same generation and technology. Performance is complicated, especially because Leica has often kept lenses designed at different times and with different technologies in the range simultaneously. The cheapest current non-APO, non-ASPH 50mm Summicron is a lens designed in the 1970s. For many years, it was generally regarded as a 'better' lens overall than its sister lens, the (non-ASPH) 50mm Summilux, which was designed in the 1960s. But then Leica launched the 50mm Summilux ASPH, which trumped it, followed by the APO-Summicron 50mm ASPH, which is generally regarded as the best of all. In practice, all these lenses are great and better test measurements don't always equate to a preferable lens - some people really like the look of photos takes with the non-ASPH Summilux, for example.",5,1726754262.0,2024-09-19 13:57:42,,0,1fkgojd
lnx0mt6,HoratioFitzmark,"The simplest practical breakdown is this:

All Leica Summicron and Summilux lenses from the last 50 years or so are good lenses.  Deciding between them comes down to these main things:  are you shooting film or digital?  is small size/weight or greater capability more important to you?  and what can you afford?

If you are shooting a digital M, particularly a more recent one, you have a far wider useable ISO range than film shooters ever dreamed of in the pre-digital days.  This means having the extra stop of wide open aperture is no longer necessary to get the shot, it is purely an aesthetic choice.

In general, summicrons are smaller and lighter than summiluxes, and summiluxes are smaller and lighter than the even faster noctiluxes.  if you don't need the speed, save the size and weight.

It used to be the case that summicrons were cheaper than summiluxes and summiluxes were cheaper than noctiluxes, but that isn't strictly true anymore.  budget carefully, buy what you can afford, and remember that you might be able to get two damn good lenses for the price of that one perfect lens.",5,1726762640.0,2024-09-19 16:17:20,,0,1fkgojd
lnvlgsv,Waterincoffeeout,"Having an additional f stop isn‚Äôt a straight upgrade, one of the ‚Äòmistakes‚Äô I made when I first started was shooting everything at f1.4 for the bokeh. Over time, I have learnt that some scenes require a wider depth of field. 

Faster lenses also come with drawbacks like less sharpness at f2/ heavier and larger footprint (especially the modern versions).",5,1726743098.0,2024-09-19 10:51:38,,0,1fkgojd
lnvf6xy,spektro123,"There are also Noctiluxes which are wider than f/1.4, Elmarits which are f/2.8, Elmars that are f/3.5 or slower except 50mm Elmar f/2.8 and Summarits, that are f/2.4 or f/2.5. You can check individual lenses here: https://wiki.l-camera-forum.com/leica-wiki.en/index.php/Main_Page

Speed = how bright the lens is. f/1.4 is faster than f/2, because you can take photos faster - shorter shutter times.

There are no additional features in faster lenses. M lenses don‚Äôt have any features except infinity lock and build in shade in some. 

Faster lenses usually are optically worse than slower lenses, especially wide open. In general Summicrons are the best optically. Recent Summiluxes are usually as good as recent crons.",2,1726739239.0,2024-09-19 09:47:19,,0,1fkgojd

lnz9ffl,vxxn,"In these contexts a lens is called ""fast"" when it has a wide aperture (small f-number) because they let in more light so they can gather enough light for a proper exposure more quickly. If you have one stop less light, you need to expose for twice as long or double your ISO to get equivalent exposure. One stop of light may not matter in many situations, especially because digital sensors perform well with high ISOs these days and doubling ISO isn't a huge deal unless you are in an extreme low light situation.

On digital people mainly enjoy f1.4 because it will give more bokeh (background blur) which some people like as a creative choice. But it much harder to get accurate focus when your depth of field is so shallow.",2,1726793176.0,2024-09-20 00:46:16,,0,1fkgojd

lo2p53g,__gcd,"* Speed refers to the maximum aperture. More open = faster. 
* In theory, f/1.4 is a straight upgrade because you can always shoot stopped down. However, the lux stopped down to f/2 does not produce exactly the same image as the cron at f/2. Check youtube for side-by-side comparisons. 
* As others have mentioned, the lux is heaver and bulkier.",1,1726850271.0,2024-09-20 16:37:51,,0,1fkgojd
lo2r5zk,fineYogurtAndBerries,"First of all, the naming convention is just something that Leica uses on their lenses, like you said:

Summilux describes F1.4 lenses,

Summicron 2.0,

and so on, so forth.

Getting a lens with F1.4 is not a ""straight upgrade"" as others said earlier. You can't just ""scale up"" a lens, these can be (and usually are) totally different optical constructions. Also, two lenses with both F1.4 can have totally different designs (e.g. ASPH vs. non-ASPH) and thus behave completely different from each other.

The F-stop just describes the ""aperture"", the wikipedia article should be an interesting read for you.  The F-stop however says almost nothing about optical quality. Only thing it says is: every full f-stop down, you have to adjust your shutter speed 2x slower, i.e. longer to get the same exposure.

As a (very coarse) rule of thumb, it is trickier to construct ""fast"" lenses, e.g. F1.4 ones than F2.0 or 2.8. That difficulty grows disproportionately the faster the lens is, resulting in more effort towards optical correction, more material use (bigger glass), more weight, and more cost.

Also, stopping down an F1.4 to F2.0 does not mean it will perform better than a well designed lens with F2.0 maximum aperture. APO-Summicrons are the best example here.",1,1726850917.0,2024-09-20 16:48:37,,0,1fkgojd
lnx8oqw,SuperbWillingness260,"Also worth noting that, for the overwhelming majority of people, discerning the difference between the good and perfect lenses is often impossible. Moreover, the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù lenses from an optical perspective can often be quite boring from an artistic perspective. Sometimes the less perfect lenses can do more for the image than the latest and greatest. If you‚Äôre purchasing, I‚Äôd recommend getting a modern voigtlander and a cheap, vintage Leica lens. That way you can figure out the style of image that you prefer before dropping $ on the expensive versions of either rendering style.",5,1726765167.0,2024-09-19 16:59:27,,0,1fkgojd

lntyd7y,mrjosh72,"Yeah, sounds like we're thinking similarly. I also feel that two cameras feels about right; three adds some confusion into the mix. 

The M10-R and M are a great pair, honestly. I love the R, and I can see the difference in the files from the Monochrom, not just at high ISO but in general. (Whether viewers can see the differences is another question.) I really like the Monochrom; there are two (first world) problems, for me: (1) The SL2-S really takes beautiful low-light pictures, and it does them in color; (2) for the kind of documentary, opportunistic photography I do, I just find that it often makes more sense to take a color camera and convert. So even though the Monochrom is better than the R in some ways, it feels like a third wheel.

My plan is to push myself to shoot a lot more with the Monochrom over the next few weeks. Perhaps I'm undervaluing it because I'm under-using it. If that doesn't turn out to be the case, maybe I'll have gotten to the top of the M11-D waitlist by then....",1,1726709919.0,2024-09-19 01:38:39,,0,1fjluge

Start with a squeeze blower such as those available from giottos or visible dust to blow away dust and debris

 

Use a clean optical-safe microfiber cleaning cloth and gently wipe in an outward spiral from the center of the lens

lnvlvpf,AltruisticCover3005,"First of all: This is not an exclusive Leica question, but a general analog photography question. To answer it, people do not need to be Leica shooters, so you might want to consider posting such questions at r/analog and get more answeres there. Nevertheless it is a rather interesting question.

I shoot 35 mm (Nikon F2, F3, FM3a and of course - otherwise I would not be here - a Leica M5), medium format (Rolleiflex 3.5E and Hasselblad 501CM) and 4x5 (Toyo 45A).

I have a full darkroom / photo lab in my basement in which I can make BW prints from all my negatives: [Images of my darkroom](https://imgur.com/a/darkroom-BiLulqC). But of course I will not print every frame from a film of 12 or 36. In the past people made contact sheets. I camera scan.

About two years ago I bough a 3d printer and tought myself a bit of 3d modelling in Fusion 360. The first thing I did was make and print some negative carriers for my Jobo 7451 4x5 enlarger (Saunders LPL 4500-2 in the rest of the world). It only came with class carriers for 4x5; now I have carriers for 36x24, 6x6 and 6x7, too.

And then I made a camera stand to use with my EFH (Essential Film Holder - google it). With this I can do camera scanning without any preparation time and without worrying about parallelism, distance or stray light. [Imgur of camera stand and negative carrier](https://imgur.com/a/3d-printed-camera-stand-efh-3d-printed-negative-carriers-lpl-4500-jobo-7451-enlarger-riSot5p)

The great thing about bis film holder - camera stand combination is that I can digitize an entire roll of 36 exposures in less than 5 minutes. (NEVER cut before you scan, if you develop at a lab, tell them to not cut!)

My Sony camera is connected to and controlled by my computer, the folder in wich the photos are stored automatically is the auto-import folder of lightroom. So while I pull the strip through the holder and klick the camera release button in the software on my computer, all images end up in lightroom automatically.

I then run negative lab pro to convert them.

Then I cut my film and put it in sleeves. I write a date and a number on the sleeves and put them into my folder, in which I store them chronologically.

I then convert the digital files to jpg with approx 6-10 MP and store them in a folder named by the same date and number as written on the sleeve. I will store ALL images of the film, even the terrible ones, because this is my ""digital contact sheet"". I will also add some keywords so that I can find these images easily.

If there are some images I really like, I will keep the DNG file and also store it in the folder, should I wish to make some digital work on it later. Otherwise I delete the DNGs now. No need for 42 MP RAW scans of all my negatives.

If I want to make a darkroom print, I browse lightroom for the key words or go through my digital folders if I roughly know the time, find the digital file, by that know the date and number of digital folder and physical sleeve and then find sleeve with the negative in my physical folder.",4,1726743323.0,2024-09-19 10:55:23,,0,1fk9uxv

lnu8g0w,GammaDeltaTheta,"Whatever else you get, I'd suggest finding a nice collapsible 50mm (5cm) lens, which makes the whole thing pocketable and matches the angle of view of the built-in viewfinder.

The 5cm Elmar f/3.5 is a popular choice, small and light and sharp, and is the lens that made Leica's reputation. You can't go wrong with this, and it's one of the most affordable options. There's also a later f/2.8 version - one advantage of that one is you get a proper aperture ring rather than the lever the slower lens uses. If you want something faster (but heavier) the 5cm Summitar f/2 is a good option. All three of these lenses can be found coated if you look around (the f/2.8 Elmar always is). Watch out for haze and fine scratches on the front element and fungus. The earlier 5cm Summar f/2 can be good if you can find a nice one, but it's uncommon to find them coated (this will have been done later, as coating was not available when they were in production) and they are often hazy (which can be cleaned when they are serviced) and the front elements are particularly soft (so often scratched). The later collapsible 5cm Summicron f/2 seems to be particularly hard to find in nice condition (at least where I live) for a reasonable price.

The 9cm Elmar f/4 is a good 90mm option, easy to find and relatively inexpensive. The 3.5 cm Summaron f/3.5 is a very nice 35mm option, generally rather more expensive than most of the lenses of other focal lengths. For anything other than 50mm lenses, you will also need a matching accessory viewfinder. The Leitz single focal length brightline finders are the best, with the Voigtl√§nder finders running them very close. Voigtl√§nder has also made some excellent modern lenses in Leica screw mount.

lnwd4j1,MattySingo37,"Cheap and Leica are not two words that are seen together very often, but with Barnack Leicas you've got some good options.

For your IIc you need to look for LTM - Leica Thread Mount lenses. Leica weren't the only company that made them so there are ""third party"" lenses out there.

Basic lens I'd look for is the Elmar 5cm (50mm) f3.5. This was the lens that would have been with your camera in the first place. If your new to buying camera gear it might be worth looking for one from a reputable dealer.

Canon, also, did LTM cameras and lenses. Their 50mm lens would be a good choice at the cheaper end. I think the 1.8 is probably the cheapest good option.

The Soviets made a range of Leica copies and LTM lenses so they might be an option. Not sure if this is a route I'd go down, no where near as good as Leitz or Canon but very cheap, especially if you want a wide angle. The Jupiter 12 35mm f2.8 is the cheapest wide you can find in LTM.

I still love it, I still use it, and I've never felt any need to upgrade it to a Summicron.  I've thought about what a Summilux would offer, and although it costs six times as much, it isn't six times better.  It just isn't worth the extra cost to me.  I've got other 50s, like an old Contax Sonnar 1.5, but they're useful for different things.  The Sonnar is great for an older look, but if I need good colours, sharpness across the plane, and a modern rendering, the Planar is the one I go for.

Otherwise, I have the Voigtl√§nder Nokton 35/1.4 MC, which was my second native M lens, and my second-fave.  Another great lens, although it's out of action now, after two botched repairs by my local camera shop a couple of years ago.  Since I've just bought a house, I have more important things to spend my money on than getting my lens re-re-repaired by someone competent!  Bit cheaper than a Planar, it's tiny, and a very, very good performer.  I'd recommend one if you can't stretch to the Zeiss or you'd rather shoot in 35, although I'm sure others will also chime in with ideas of Skopars too.

tips: 

-  see if you can get the motor-winder, it's not expensive. It provides a better grip and would still allow manual advance if you prefer that option.

-  the lens is very versatile, but is not well corrected and shows slight distortion at closer to 28mm, so be careful there ;

-  get a sling cross-body strap for it, you'll thank me later;

- most important thing: read the manual and understand the functionality. This is a very conventional cam, but still, read the manual.

lnri7g1,mrjosh72,"I'm using an SL2-S with an M10-R and M10M. I went with the SL2-S just because it was way cheaper used‚Äîmy 'well-used' camera was less than half the cost of a new SL3. I wasn't sure if I'd like having an SL camera and wanted to limit my expenditure. At first I found a lot to dislike‚ÄîI am very acclimatized to the M system‚Äîbut after owning it for around eight weeks I'm finding that it's incredibly practical and quite fun. I use it mainly for low light (where it excels) and sports photography, and in bad weather. I may even sell my M10M and an M lens or two to fund a pair of APO-Summicrons.

It seems like there are lots of upgrades in the SL3, including better autofocus, reduced weight and size, and the articulating screen. But my logic was that I wanted to start with the SL2-S and see if any of its limitations mattered to me in use. So far, taking pictures mainly of family life, landscapes, and my kids' sports, I haven't found anything to complain about. I'm mainly using the Leica 24-70 (which produces surprisingly beautiful results), the Sigma 70-200 (ditto), and my M lenses, especially my 50 Summilux ASPH with the adapter.

* Are you substantially limited by your current kit?  Make sure you have a POV on what you expect from the M11 you cannot do today.

I am as bad a Leicaddict as there is (though only film bodies).  When I buy something additional, I always ask two questions:  Will this do something I cannot easily do right now?  OR  Am I buying this for the joy of a toy with the hope of seeing it appreciate in value?

An M11 can grant you new capabilities *if* you are clear on how you plan to do new things with it.  It also has that joy of toy to it.  However, it will almost certainly not rise in value, but decline as it is obsoleted by newer models.

Leica had bought Minox in the 90s and I think may still had a stake in them when these little cameras were released, which probably helped with the trademarks! They were actually outsourced to China, a followup to a [similar range](http://www.submin.com/8x11/collection/minox/introduction.htm#classic) of small replica cameras that took Minox-format film and were made for them in Japan.

Earlier in its history Minox had been the preeminent manufacturer of high quality subminiature film cameras in Germany, with their former factory not far from Leica's own. [These models](http://www.submin.com/8x11/collection/minox/), which don't look anything like a Leica, are the classic 'spy' cameras you see in all those cold war movies and are beautifully made. Today, Minox is out of the miniature camera business and makes things like binoculars and hunting scopes.",2,1726711601.0,2024-09-19 02:06:41,,0,1fjyr47

First thing is the size.. GR3 trumps the dlux hands down..

Second, start up for the GR3 from off to photo is about 1 sec.. if you fire the shutter button.. not that I ever do it..  I currently have the camera with the optical view finder at the moment + center single point focus lock.. and half press and recompose the photo.. honest total time is about 2-3 secs. DLux 8.. same situation.. I'd take me 5-7 seconds to capture the same photo.. I feel like the leica takes between 3-5 seconds for it to open up and allow the screen or evf to be useful. If I only have iphone and DLux on my own.. is pull out the iphone for a rushed photo if the situation calls for it.. otherwise the DLux definitely is of better quality for photos..

Ergonomics, I believe is a toss up and is dependent on your hands. My hands are a men's glove in-between medium and large size. DLux wins by a bit, but requires the grip accessory and is a much bigger camera. The grip allows me to have a a secure feeling with the grip even hanging on 2-3 finger tips in hand. For the GR3 I have a small leather grip that is secured on the rings on the right side and generally fits, 3 fingers for a secure fit.

Menu, as my first leica with a leica menu.. all other menus suddenly suck.. the feel of the leica interface makes me sad as I just learned how backward and lame my Sony and Ricoh menu system are.. haha üòÇ 

The app... Leica Fotos all the way!!! This is another very well optimized thing if you transfer photos to your phone wirelessly.. it is very efficient.. buuuuuut it occasionally crashes when printing multiple photos for the sofort 2.. and for the DLux when transferring big files..

lnrh32c,SuperbWillingness260,"Agree with this. I'm fortunate enough that my employer has a relationship with B&H that allows me to get a discount - which can be pretty substantial when buying Leica gear. The M11-D, however, was something that I had been anticipating for a long time and had been discussing with my local Leica store for months. When it was announced, I was preoccupied with work and it was like 5-6 hours before I could make it over to the B&H  website. I was worried that I was too late, and if I were to ever even receive one, I would've been so far down the list that it would have taken forever to get it. Fortunately, my local reps called me as I was logging on to the website and told me they had one waiting for me with my name on it.  Lesson of the story is that while I don't think they have a crazy policy like Rolex where you have to spend x amount of money before being offered what you actually want, I think it is good practice to establish a relationship with your local store. This is especially true because Leica produces their various models in fits and starts rather than continuously. For example, if you want a Q3 and they're sold out everywhere, it might be months before more come onto the market. Thus, having that relationship where they know you and know that you are waiting on the camera/lens can help you get to the front of the line when it eventually is in stock",3,1726679785.0,2024-09-18 17:16:25,,0,1fjv7qq

The problem with the CL is that the battery is in the film compartment and if you are like me, with far too many film cameras, I tend to have half finished rolls in all of them, so that when I come back to the CL, its battery is always flat. I use the 625 converter and PR44 cells in my M5 and Leicaflex SL2 where the batteries are external and can be easily changed mid spool. I have given up with the MR-9 regulated 625 converters as the Schottky diodes they use, have a very finite life.

I think the Qs are great, and it's a step up, being full frame, but just consider that for many Leica users, the LTM and M-mount lenses are a major draw. I have a very affordable one from 1939 for example that I just love. There are so many gems. Also, the rangefinder system is a major draw if you do like shooting manual focus, and once you try it with a focus tab you may fall in love with the experience.

I've owned four Leicas, one of which was an M9 Monochrom.

My advice is this:  Monochroms aren't worth it.

When you lose the color data, you have to go back to using physical colored filters on your lens.  Compared to simulating filters in post, using physical filters blows.  In post, there's no exposure compensation.  You can try different filters and then choose.  Once you pick one, you can adjust the intensity of the effect.  And heaven forbid you are a weirdo like me that likes a blue filter, they are nigh impossible to find anymore in sizes for rf lenses.",8,1726642308.0,2024-09-18 06:51:48,,0,1fjmi1m

- 100% manual focus 
- Killer lenses 
- Killer form factor 
- Top notch quality (at least on the M10, M11 seems to have proven otherwise)
- Extremely simple to use (once you learn how to focus)
- Rangefinder 
- Makes what you see in the viewfinder an _approximate_ of what you get in the picture, something I find liberating. It makes my photographs more human and less clinical
- Simplicity: one camera and one lens. Your bank account becomes the limiting factor. 

What I don't like:

- Price: while I use it as an excuse to stick to one camera and one lens, I do think the cameras and lenses are overpriced due to the brand. And yes, the quality _is_ certainly great, and my camera and lens were made in Europe (Germany), but I still feel the margins are high.

Remember that it isn't about the shooting, it is about the shot.

As to being justified, if you can afford it without hardship, and you like the camera, go for it.  Leicas aren't magic.  If they have any magic powers at all, they have the ability to make men irrationally justify spending too damn much money chasing a level of image quality that they aren't getting, making them think it's a gear issue when it is, in fact, a skill issue.  Otherwise they're just another high end camera with nice lenses, but not the only ones.

To that end, you don't need a camera to force you to shoot exclusively black and white.

The Q is the gateway drug into Leica especially from Fuji x100/xpro quasi rangefinder, but quite a few do go over the dark side with an actual rangefinder. Id suggest to test out which fits your style of shooting. The evf lag is apparent ( if not ever so slightly with Q3) when compared to a rangefinder imo.

But imo for the best stealth id go with a Ricoh GRIII.Its the most compact setup and you can't beat the snap focus which is modern take to hyperfocal/ range focusing. Oh btw the Leica Q distance scales is a gimmick brought forward from the type 113 precursor to the Q. If you compare it to the distance scales of an actual summicron or lux there is more of a precise focusing scale with m lenses

Like you I went through the gauntlet from Fuji xpro/x100 to Leica 113, Q, M and now mostly use GRIII as it's most convenient ( I know hersey in Leica community).

The Q2M is a $4,000+ *used* point and shoot camera, from arguably the most luxury camera brand in all of human history... Dont get me wrong, they are awesome and their build quality is execptional. However, for $4,000+ for a **point and shoot camera** you arent spending that type of money because capability is your first priority lol.

So yes, as with all luxury items, Leica being no exception... at its core you buy Leica because you can afford it and dont necessarily care that your money isnt getting you something like an a7v or and a9iii that would absolutely wipe the floor with a Q2M, M11, Q3, SL2, etc.

I love my Leicas... I have 4 of them, they are my favorite cameras to use... but spending like $6,200 on my M240 in 2013 and like $4,500 on my Q in 2015 wasnt the best use of that money from a capability standpoint. Anybody who tells you they buy Leica because they are buying the most capable camera their money can buy is just being silly. So I'll be the honest Leica owner... I own all of mine because I like the way they look, I like their build quality, I like they way they feel in my hands, and I like that the are rare in the camera community. 

If you are looking for the most bang for your buck, or trying hard to justify spending an amount of money on a Leoca from a capability standpoint... the reality is its just never going to fully make sense.

Edit:

As an aside. I basically shoot B&W on all of my cameras... D850, M240, Q, X100V, X-E3, X-T4, etc... I even bulk buy and load HP5 for all of my 35mm cameras lol. Never really felt a need for a monochrome sensor camera. Sure, I get the urge every so often to get one just to experience it, but im not really sure its necessary. 

I think most people buy monochrome cameras because they think its neat, which I agree they are neat, but I also think youd be hard pressed to find anyone who can pick a B&W shot taken on a monochrome camera out of a lineup of other RAWs processed as B&W lol.",5,1726643212.0,2024-09-18 07:06:52,,0,1fjmi1m
lnqg8ud,Moo-Crumpus,"The Q2M uses a full-frame black and white CMOS sensor, 50.4/47.3 million pixels (total/effective), without color and low-pass filters. The resolution and light sensitivity is therefore higher than that of a color sensor.

Let's talk about microlenses on the sensor. These are used to direct as much light as possible onto the sensor from larger angles of incidence. With a fixed combination of lens and sensor, optimized microlenses, ideally calculated for that very lens, are possible for all areas on the sensor. This is because it is possible to calculate the angle at which the light will hit each individual pixel. But precise software correction is also possible with that set up. Result is: less scattering, which leads to even greater sharpness, ergo higher resolution and details, higher light sensitivity.

These are the best technical conditions that can be achieved for maximum quality, afaik.

I am aware of the advantages of monochrome sensors. I am an M11M user.  

I just took issue with the blanket statement ""For technical reasons, better imaging performance is not possible with color sensors and interchangeable lenses."" 

I believe that to be untrue in the case of the Q2. Having a fixed lens allows the sensor and lens to be optimized for each other through microlenses etc, in theory. However, I believe this is not the case in this example. It is obvious from looking at the DNG files with the baked-in lens correction disabled, that most (all?) the correction is done in software. This is the case for many modern mirrorless designs. It just makes more sense to correct in software to allow for a smaller lens. So, whilst no one outside Leica will know for sure, I suspect that most optical optimizations in lens design for the Q2 are for size and form factor rather than optical performance. And any correction that can be done in software could also be done for an interchangeable lens. 

I also think the Q2 lens is a bit overrated anyway, but that's another controversial debate ;-).",1,1726678223.0,2024-09-18 16:50:23,,0,1fjmi1m

The thing is, the sunny 16 rule is not a hyper precise way of metering in the first place. It's a very useful tool to use and it allows for great results if you're good at deducting the light, but it does not allow for as much precision as you're seeking, so I personally would not put in the time of creating development recipes to get closer to the exact reciprocals.",9,1726597179.0,2024-09-17 18:19:39,,0,1fj64tm

lnm6ilw,AltruisticCover3005,"I use a very precise and trustworthy Nikon FM3a and the Heiland Splitgrade controller on my enlarger to make a sensitometric test with each and every film. 

I will shoot a big white surface (no need for a grey card the exposure meter will meter it at middle grey anyhow) without any shadow on it in bright sunlight (in very constant light). I take 16 shots from Zone 0 to X hwith very small third stop steps from 0 to III and full stop steps afterwards. This is my sequence: 0, I+2, I+1, I, I-1, I-2, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X and one test 

Then I wind two or three more times, open the camera in a changing back, cut the film and take the exposed film out into a development tank and can use the rest for the next test step.

First step: Develop with the standard time of your developer and film. Then I put the film on my enlarger and now I can measure the density above fog of each of the 15 test shots. The one with density 0.10 to 0.12 is my actual Zone 1 and I have to adjust my film speed accordingly. Then I check if I hit some good values withthe densities at zone V (ideally around 0.72) and VII (1.10). If not, I know that I have to change my development time.

So I take the rest of the film and make a sequences of shots, this time I already adjust the ISO to the ISO I had determined, but this time I change the development time as required to bring my Zone V and VII closer to their nominal values.

Sometimes I nail it with this, sometimes I have to use another half or even full roll of film, but after four trys (and two full rolls) I always know the actual film speed and development time for my personal film developer combination.

  
So what does that mean? I am an engineer and I love doing measurements and creating rows of data and diagrams, so I feel I absolutely NEED to know my film speed. Sunny 16 is very scary. 

Of course I use it regularly and with quite some success, so it is not all bad, I assume.

  
The interesting question would be: How do you intend to make a fest for ISO1600? What average gradient would you like to approach? The film is not ISO1600 no matter what you do and you will loose shadows if you try. So how - in a scientific understanding - would you do such a test?

What I am doing is clear: I know the standards as defined and try to find the speed and time at which my film matches the standard and whatever film speed I find, that's the film speed I will use.

lnmscms,Broken_Perfectionist,"LOL, I too am an engineer and have a similar affliction. üòÇ

I designed a [JOBO-like rotary processor](https://www.reddit.com/r/Darkroom/comments/1cl1cu2/so_i_made_a_thing/) to help fine tune my development times and to make the developing process more consistent. I temperature compensate my development times to the half degree increments using the logarithmic formulas from Kodak for HC-110 to ensure repeatability. I've also set up a [Test dummy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Darkroom/comments/1f1be5x/sanity_check_zone_system_developing/) and spot meters the various zones from 3 to 7. I use my Nikon F5 and blast through a roll while bracketing the shots using ISO 400, 800 and 1600 and keeping the aperture the same. Then in a dark bag, I'll snip 6 inch strips which will be enough to contain all three brackets. Each strip literally becomes a test strip with exposures of ISO 400, 800, 1600 on there. I store them in another dev tank and one strip at a time, I'll put it through my makeshift JOBO and play with the development times until I get my Zone 8 or 9 to basically clip the highlights.

Ultimately, it's a spin off of ""expose for the shadows and develop for the highlights."" By varying the ISO's in each strip, I'm exposing for shadow details, then by developing each strip for different lengths of time, I'm trying to optimize my highlight details. At the end of the day, I'll know the optimal development time for each ISO I tested.

You're right, there isn't a real standard for what underexposing more than two stops should yield. Instead I see the shadow detail as what's lost is lost and focus on the development time to preserve the highlights. In the test dummy link, you'll see that I have white towel with texture. I basically tune the development time until I can no longer see the texture and that should be more or less my Zone 8 or 9. I can also use eyedropper in Capture One to figure out where the tone falls between 0 to 255 and use that as my objective measurement. Once I have that time figured out, I'll know for this particular ISO, I can develop the film for this long and preserve or get as much highlight detail as possible. It basically becomes a develop by inspection. Once I have that development time for that ISO, at that particular temperature, I make a spreadsheet for the water temperature and use the logarithmic formulas for temperature compensating HC-110 to determine the time at 68F and then +/- 20 deg F in 0.5 deg F increments. This way if I know I shot the roll at 800, all I need to do is measure the temp of the water and look across the Excel sheet and it'll tell me the development time. I'll do this for ISO 400, ISO 800, ISO 1600.

I read Ansel's The Negative and understand the benefits of knowing the true film speed but sometimes you just need to push a film because you're going indoors and you don't have enough light. There is a personal/optimal film speed for each film stock but I'd like to have my dev times at the ready for time when I need a little more speed or a lot less motion blur. In those instances, I understand there will be a shadow detail loss but what am I going to do? I don't want to miss Bigfoot making an appearance during a game of nighttime pickleball. üòä

With all that said, I'm wondering if it makes sense to go through all my testing to optimize an ISO range of 250, 500, 1000 since it aligns neatly with the shutter speed dials since I don't really have a dial for 1/400, 1/800 or 1/1600 of a second although one can argue that the 1/1000 is closer to 1/700 which I've actually found when I made a laser shutter speed tester too.",1,1726606663.0,2024-09-17 20:57:43,,0,1fj64tm

The idea that you're shooting THAT fast in rapidly changing conditions and you need 1/3 of a stop of precise control... AND you are making meticulous notes across a whole roll... it just sounds like too many unlikely things happening all together.

And no, I don‚Äòt think it makes any sense to do so, because the sunny 16 rule has been taught since ages using the current ISO numbering system to wich you should stay as close to as possible. 60, 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000 are the numbers on cameras since the Leica M3 replaced the III. And people have equated that to ISO 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1600 for ages and it always worked well.

Most importantly: It always was only an approximation. The ISO shutter time numbers actually do work great. When I set my ambient light meter to ISO100 and meter in really bright sun light at noon in summer, I will get an EV of 15.0, which at ISO100 is f/16 and 1/125 s. so the 1/125 s at ISO100 works perfectly for me even acording to my Sekonic 508.

I'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding you but here's an example of the proposed workflow, assume I would finish the roll on the same day, I assess the lighting conditions for the day, it's bright and sunny, I'll rate the film at ISO 500, set my shutter speed at 1/500, and then just adjust my aperture only for the rest of the day. If some clouds float by, I'll go to f/11, if the subject I want to shoot is in the shade, I'll go to f/8, clouds disappear, I'll go back to f/16. Basically I'll keep my shutter speed at 1/500 for the most part. Then since through my testing, I figured out my bespoke development time for ISO 500, I'll develop my film and I'll get bright highlights that don't clip and sufficient shadow detail. If I go with the ""off the rack"" generic time from Massive Dev Chart or Ilford's datasheet for ISO 400, I'll probably get similar results but if I can eek out just a little more detail, why not?

I haven't shot HP5 in the M4 yet but if I were to rate it at 800, what shutter speed would you recommend for full sun, f/16? 1/500 or 1/1000?    

When I laser tested my M4, the 1/1000 speed over 10 measurements averaged out to be 1/628. The 1/500 speed averaged out to be 1/388. When I overhauled and replaced the curtains on my IIIc, I spent many iterations tuning the 1/1000 speed and was able to get an average speed of 1/857. 

To fine tune my development times, I use my Nikon F5 because it has arguably one of the most accurate shutters of all time, so I'm confident that 1/1000 is 1/1000. 

Anyways, I guess the point is that I can be super accurate with the development times and the exposure testing but each individual camera (except the F5) will have it's only variabilities to add more slop to slop.

lnlaxnr,Daniel_Melzer,"That would depend on whatever makes it not work. 

What i can tell you is that leicas are a bit more on the complicated site of cameras to repair but usually manageable with enough determination. But you could easily f off some calibration which, in the worst case would require specialised tools. 
Considering there are no electronics in there it‚Äòs pure mechanical work. 

That said you would also need to invest in some special tools, clamps, screwdrivers, lubricants, solvents and a good work surface which quickly adds up. Oh and while there are no electronics itself there is a cable for the flash so for a disassembly you would need a soldering station or iron. 

And to add to that, Leica spare parts are absurdly pricey and hard to get. Unless there a piece of film stuck between some gears you‚Äòll have to pay.

Even if you‚Äôre shooting the standard profile in camera that is a look and the DNG can be thought of as similar to a raw file flatter and with more flexibility.

lnmqcnq,nevsf,"My workflow is to use the DNG file, apply a profile (usually Adobe Standard), then mess with the sliders. 

A raw format like DNG needs a profile to map the RGB Bayer array values to whatever color space we're working in - typically Adobe RGB or sRGB. The JPEG files generated in-camera have whatever profile you've chosen applied in-camera to the raw file. 

In theory, you could apply the same profile in Lightroom Classic as the camera did to the raw file, but unfortunately for whatever reason those profiles aren't available in Lightroom (some cameras, like the Lumix S9, provide the in-camera profiles to Lightroom, which is very nice). In a raw workflow with a Leica, you have to choose other profiles than what's in the camera. I have no idea why Leica profiles aren't available in Lightroom - maybe Leica thinks it would give away too much of their color science IP? 

(I guess we could reverse-engineer the Leica in-camera profiles from the  JPEG's, but I've never seen that so far). 

Incidentally, I see people use ""presets"" and ""profiles"" interchangeably when talking about Lightroom. A ""profile"" is a mapping from the raw file to a color space (eg. Adobe RGB or sRGB applied to a JPEG). A ""preset"" is a setting of the buttons and sliders in Lightroom (including selecting a profile). 

Finally, in Lightroom Classic, you can tell it to apply a preset automatically per-camera. It's under Preferences>Presets>Raw Defaults. Once you get your presets dialed in (profile + slider settings) it makes for a pretty efficient workflow.",1,1726606047.0,2024-09-17 20:47:27,,0,1fiv0su

lnnfk80,GammaDeltaTheta,"If you want an auto mode on the M6, you might be better off with an older flash. Many have one or more 'A' modes that use a sensor in the flash unit itself, typically with a thyristor circuit that cuts off the flash when it has detected there is sufficient light. This came before today's dedicated TTL modes (of course the M6 Classic can't do TTL flash anyway) and was sometimes included as an additional mode even in TTL flash units (flagship dSLR flashes usually have it - Nikon's SB-28 and SB-80 are readily available, but may be larger than you want).

One late model non-TTL flash with A and M modes I have used on the M6 is the Metz 36 C-2, which is fairly small but has a versatile bounce head. Another you might try is the Metz 34 CS-2 - fixed head, but the original accessories include a flash bracket and a stand to use it as a slave flash (it has a sensor for this). It's small and takes lithium CR2s and was often recommended as a less expensive alternative to Leica's own SF-20 (also made by Metz) for non-TTL cameras.

Note that some other recent flashes use 'A' to designate a TTL mode, so check the specs. Also, for the Ricoh make sure you don't use something with a high trigger voltage.

lnf8ke4,zach66827,"The Digilux 2 caught my eye for some reason and since a M isn't quite in my budget yet, it seemed like a fun way to play around with a Leica. Took it up to the mountains last night and shot a bit. Some quick thoughts:

* It's verrrrrrrrrry slow. It often takes 5 or more seconds to write an image to the SD card before you can take another photo.  
* It only goes up to ISO 400 and even at that grain becomes apparent quickly. 
* Had to buy a new SD card as it doesn't take anything over 2GB
* The viewfinder and back screen are pretty low res so it can be hard to tell if you nailed focus even after the fact. That said, most images were in focus. 
* The exposure latitude isn't great, especially by today's standards. Shadow detail gets lost very quickly. Interesting, I found highlights easier to recover. 
* Shooting in 4:3 is definitely new to me. 

All that means a camera that actually felt fairly film like to shoot in the sense that, because it's so slow, you can't just shoot and shoot. You need to slow down and choose the shot. And you really can't tell what it looks like until you get it off the camera. Some quick edits on these but I do like how some came out.",10,1726500950.0,2024-09-16 15:35:50,,0,1fi7nvc

I zone focus at 21mm or 28mm. At 35mm I use a modified zone focus system where I keep my finger on the focus tab, look at what I want to shoot, estimate the distance, and try to micro adjust as I bring to my eye (think of this as two settings, close and far).  Get to know where the focus tab on the lens sits for infinity, close, and about 3 meters. 50 and above, really tough. One suggestion I found useful was to always start at one end of the focus (ie infinity) and work back until in focus, rather than jumping back and forth on the focus ring like a fighter pilot trying to lock on a target. Start from close focus and move toward infinity if you are trying to focus on a subject moving away from you. Practice on the M6 without even taking a picture. Just look at a spot, guess the focus distance, and look at the rangefinder patch and see how far off you are. With film you can probably go to f8 or even f11.",5,1726582491.0,2024-09-17 14:14:51,,0,1fioub6

With 35mm you will want to shoot at f/8 if you can.

Even if you have to snap the shutter for the moment before getting focus perfect, at least you might be closer than relying on zone focusing. Watch the great street photographers - they are constantly focusing while moving. Very small movements all the time - I liken it to using an X-box controller. Or like driving. Every once in awhile one needs to make a big movement with the steering wheel to fit a situation, but much of the time it's just a constant stream of small movements. Get used to that, and your 'hits' will increase vs f/8 and point, which can also lead to a really boring photos with no separation of subject, unless of course that's the look you're after, which is fine.",1,1726584249.0,2024-09-17 14:44:09,,0,1fioub6

lnngxvh,AnonymousBromosapien,"Thats a fair question, ill try and explain. Just as a note, I am mot trying to come off as being rude, im just going to be very straight with you so that the points are clear so that you can best understand.

First, your post is a very basic question, with a very simple answer... one of which could have been solved with even an ounce of knowledge on Leica Q and Leica M systems. 

So that may have been something that was immediately off putting with how you effectively said *""Hey, I didnt google a single thing before coming here to post this.""*... which a lot of people view as annoying being that you came here to engaging in a conversation that you did nothing to prepare for. I.e. You didnt even look up *""Leica Q vs M""*, because if you did youd know the differences and why someone would pick one over the other.

Second, the tone of your post title sort of reads as *""So why would anyone in their right mind buy a Q whrn the M is unquestionably better""*. I have both, so im indifferent, but surely you can see how that might read as a bit annoying to some.

Third, and kinda coming back full circle here... the answer to you question is because they are fundamentally different. One is a fixed lens cameras, the other an interchangeable lens camera. One has autofocus, the other does not. One has an EVF, the other is a rangefinder camera. One is effectively *""pay and play""*, the other requires a body and lens purchase... which means decisions need to be made. Lastly cost... the newest Q is like $6,000 all-in, the M is like $8,000 + a lens that can cost anywhere from just $100 to $15,000. And those are just the main differences that even a single google search will tell you.

So basically when you ask a very basic question... of which very simple and easy to find answers... you are already kinda setting a tone that is kinda annoying lol. And then when you add your comments like *""huh, thats amazing""* as if youve been provided some astonishing, impossible to find information in the comments section it just sort of perpetuates people's annoyance and results in downvotes lol.

Again, not trying to be rude with the above, just trying be clear and explain it to you.",9,1726615223.0,2024-09-17 23:20:23,,0,1fjcxlz

lnl29ji,ghostdrived,"hi, i know about this. If you have experience with tools, at the back of the lens, you can see a pair of notches at the rear element. then, a bit inside, you can see another pair of notches on the inner block. for some reason, some Voigtlander lenses (newer ones) are just tight enough on the retaining lock (inner notches) and that caused this wobbling to happen. if you use the hood, it makes it even more probably because equipping in and out the hood does unscrew it a bit more than just using that aperture ring. It's not dangerous and likely will last you a good 3-5 years. but if you're slightly adventurous, you can tighten it yourself, you'll feel a slight movement as you tighten. it shouldn't be difficult, imagine like tightening a screw that's already 95% tight. usually use the lens spanner. 

i tighten my 35 Ultron, 50 1.5 ii Nokton, on others' 28mm 2.8 Skopar, and 28mm Ultron ii.

but, do so if you have experience in repairing. if not, leave it be as it won't affect much. even if it came loose one day, putting it back together is very easy because nothing broke. ive never seen a tighter tolerance lens than Voigtlander, they make them so meticulously. it's 95% not a big deal if it wobbles that much.",1,1726587196.0,2024-09-17 15:33:16,,0,1fipiu1

A 24 on the M is a closer focal length perspective to the Q before it processes and corrects the image, I read it somewhere on the internet, so it must be true. But seriously a 24 gives a little more width and slightly different perspective to a 28.

lnfpcan,FattyLumpkinIsMyPony,"These are pretty different choices. Is there a reason you have narrowed it down to these two? I would have expected interest in an M6 vs MP, or M4 vs MA.

I have an M4 and just recently passed on a decent deal for an MP. I personally dislike the black paint and don't think a light meter is worth the higher price tag. I am considering an MA though, mostly just bc I like the black chrome.

Like you mentioned, the M4 is way cheaper than an MP. Even if you got a good deal on the MP and not the M4, the M4 is still half the cost, $2000+ difference.  With the same lens, these bodies take the same photos. And you do still need a lens. This price difference is a big contributing factor.

Do you need a light meter? If not, or if you are fine with an external one, then an M4 is great. If you don't need a meter but want a newer camera, I think the MA is nicer aesthetically than the MP, and cheaper used than the MP. If you need a meter then you have to go MP, or consider an M6.

I don't think you will have a difficult time finding used cameras of either model in Japan, or probably locally. I'm in the US and it is not difficult here.

As far as build quality, they are both great but the MP is not technically all brass. The top and bottom plates are, but the internals are steel. This makes them more durable and can take a winder, but most people will say the brass internals of the M4 make it smoother. M4 top and bottom are also brass. There are also some cost cutting parts on the MP that are plastic that used to be metal on the M4 like the part that resets the frame counter, which is known to break on the MP. Since covid new MPs have also been having some QC issues so you might want to look for older used models. I believe the general consensus is that the M4 is the better built camera, during a time when analog cameras were the company's primary focus. Both will serve you well though, I just don't put a ton of stock in the newer=better mentality. 

The winder and film advance controls are also different but that's purely personal preference. MP has 28mm frame lines if you need them and the new finder, but the M4 finder is not as bad as the M6 for flaring.

I guess the TLDR is... is a light meter and newer construction worth $2000+ to you?",7,1726506350.0,2024-09-16 17:05:50,,0,1fi8ajt

Many view it as the pinnacle of Leica‚Äôs historic M series in that it has the build quality of the earlier M3 but the conveniences of the later cameras. 

If you have the budget for an MP, then you could likely afford a very well-preserved example of the M4 (perhaps even a black chrome version) and an excellent lens. For me and many others, lenses are the primary appeal of the M system, so limiting your lens selection seems like a short-sighted move.

The MP has a meter and the full set of framelines (28/35/50/75/90/135), but has a retro wind-on lever and rewind knob last seen in the M2 and M3. The original M4 has a smaller set of framelines (35/50/90/135), but whether that's a disadvantage or a preferred (less cluttered) option depends on the user. The M4 and its derivatives (the M4-2, with the same framelines as M4, and the M4-P, with a full set of framelines) have the 'modern' style articulated wind-on lever and canted rewind crank.

lnhlh92,SpacemonkeySTI,"For a camera you can buy new, it's the purist's option. Even though the MP doesn't require the battery to function,  the argument is that it's a feature that isn't necessary for the photographic process. I think there is something pretty appealing about that and it probably scratches the same itch in someone who is really into the horology of a watch. Something purely mechanical, simple, and beautiful. It's that extra bit that pushes you as a photographer to know your stuff as if shooting film already in a digital age isn't doing that enough already haha

Cons - sometimes lighting situations can be oddly tricky where sunny 16 just won't cut it. I can take out my phone to get a reading, but maybe I just missed the moment. So you kinda of have to anticipate that when you walk into a new situation. Experience will eventually get you to learn your settings for those situations. 

Besides your phone, you can get a hotshot light meter like one Keks or reflex labs makes, but then now your hotshoe is occupied and maybe you want to use flash (granted if you're going to use flash you should already know what your settings should be). But then the light meter also just 1 more thing to carry with you when you're out. If you bought an MP/M6 Reissue, that little piece of equipment is just always with you and you can choose whether or not to use it.

It's not really a con, but it is something to consider. The m-a is black chrome vs MP's black paint. I really enjoy the patina of the black paint which aesthetically makes your copy unique to you and how you've used the camera. Similar to putting in the work for fading a pair of raw denim.. People may have a similar item, but it just won't look the same. My M-A looks just as it did on day 1! So that's something to consider",3,1726528928.0,2024-09-16 23:22:08,,0,1fi8ajt

But the SF60 is essentially a Nissin i60s (modified for Leica), so you need the equivalent Nissin Air10s transmitter (aka the SF C1). Radio systems don't work across brands. You can't use a Godox transmitter to talk to a Nissin transceiver in a Nissin flash, only a Godox transceiver in a Godox flash or a Godox receiver (X1R).

lnbayl8,EvoX650,"The steel rim and its vintage counterpart are sort of what I'd call a 'tale of two lenses', very glowy and characterful wide open (but still with defined edges, which is very Mandler), with tons of undercorrected spherical aberration, but it sharpens up very well as you stop it down, to by the time you're around f5.6 or so, it's sharp from corner to corner. Color is distinctively Mandler as well on the vintage lens, leaning a bit cool and green, and a little warmer on the reissue.

The modern Voigtlander lenses have a sort of 'shared character' among all of them: High contrast and sharp, sometimes sharper than their Leica counterparts, usually with lots of vignetting and chromatic aberration/purple+green fringing at wider apertures. The bokeh is usually a little less busy compared to the Leica stuff. The color is less warm than the ASPH lenses, but not quite as cool as the older Mandler lenses. The rendering's a bit more clinical compared to the Leica stuff in general, but not necessarily in a bad way. The Nokton Classic is going to be a bit more vintage-flavored in that it'll be a bit wilder and softer wide open, but it'll still have that sort of modern Voigtlander signature to it.

My subjective take: For the 35mm focal length, the 35 Lux pre-ASPH is my favorite. The dual-nature of that lens and its reissue are what make it worth the cost to me. I'm a Mandler fan in general, so I'll almost always take an old Leica lens over any other M-mount option, but with the modern Karbe-designed ASPH stuff, it's hard to justify the price over the Voigtlander lenses unless you have really specific tastes in lens rendering which can justify the premium. I've always been very particular about chromatic aberration, so while I typically avoid the faster Voigtlander lenses for color photography, I do like their slower, more apochromatic stuff quite a lot.",4,1726435536.0,2024-09-15 21:25:36,,0,1fhcugo

my summilux is soft wide open but as I stop down, the ""leica glow"" becomes a lot lesser which is rather interesting (can be a little intense). I find the character of all these old lens share one thing in common, they have 2 different behaviours (wide open and then some). my summaron 35mm gives this particular glow wide open @3.5 similar to my summilux wide open (aside from bokeh that is). so in a way, they aren't interchangeable like you can't imitate the summaron glow at f3.5 with the summilux @3.5 which was quite interesting imo. I have the LLL 35mm 8 element that exhibit a similar glow wide open as well but perhaps due to the age of the lens as well, you see that it's glow is slightly different (I never compared with an actual 8 element) but there is a difference in the glow (I'd just call it as a glow that hasn't 'open up' yet)",2,1726418727.0,2024-09-15 16:45:27,,0,1fhcugo

lncrnuj,erickchevez44,"I think my experience could be helpful to you as I had a similar journey.

I had a Canon kit with most of the L primes. Fantastic camera and lenses but too big and funny enough I felt the autofocus to be too perfect that it made shooting boring for me. I only did photography as a hobby back then so enjoyment was a huge factor.

I got a Q2 as a complimentary/travel camera to this kit. I took both to a photo trip across Oregon in the US and slowly stopped using the R6 after seeing how amazing the files from the Q2 were turning out. I took some of mu favorite photos ever during that trip with the Q2.

That experience was my gateway drug to Leica. I sold my Canon kit and bought a Leica SL2 with the summilux-m 50mm and summicron-m 28mm lenses. Loved it! So then bought the M10 pre-owned too as I was just loving the M lenses but wanted to shoot with a travel-friendly camera instead of the SL2.

Absolutely loved the M10 so sold my M10 and the Q2 to buy an M11‚Ä¶and thats were thing started getting weird. Although I love the M11, I just miss my Q2 every day. None of my M lenses (Summilux-m 35, Summilux-m 50 and summicron-m 28) feel as sharp as the Q2. That could just be my focusing, although I feel like a have a really good hit ratio. And now I dont have a great camera to pass around to my girlfriend or friends and family to use during trips and to get some shots of myself as well. I love the rangefinder for how it feels and how it slows me down but you can‚Äôt beat the functionality of an electronic viewfinder.

I wouldn‚Äôt sell my SL2 now because I‚Äôm starting to shoot commercial stuff with it, and my M11 was my goal for so long that I feel weird about selling it, so I‚Äôm saving money to buy a pre-owned Q2. I just feel like I peaked with that camera.

lnba1ry,RacletteFoot,"Well look, if you can't afford a Q3 or M but think that's the one you need to have, then skip the whole thing for now, especially if you have doubts that the fixed lens will work for you. That's a lot of money to spend on something that might not work for you. If you are used to a variety of lenses, test out first whether you like shooting with a fixed lens or if that is too limiting for you.

I wasn't sure if I'd like shooting with just one prime lens and decided to try it out with the one single lens gadget I had: My cell phone.

So, I took a lot of time walking around, taking a ton of photos with my cell phone while making sure I never, ever zoomed in or out. I loved the results - being limited made me more creative.

Still, I decided to not go out and buy a Q3 - although money is not an object, fortunately. Alas, I opted for a Ricoh GR3HDF and I just love, love, love the experience. This experience taught me a number of important things:

1.) I am totally fine not having zoom lenses or exchangeable lenses.

I recently added a mint SL2 & SL 35 APO for a lot less than the cost of a 2nd hand Summicron-M 35 APO and I couldn't be happier. It is a big system, perfectly capable, it adds another dimension to my photography.

I generally shoot M10, M10-R, M11-M with a lens collection built over many years, I also use a Q2-M for easy no futz shooting.

lnckoi3,AnonymousBromosapien,"It feels like you are getting lost in the specs more than anything... like what is wrong with the 24mp SL2s for stills? 

If you are just doing *""daily life recording""* then im just having a hard time understanding why you are lookimg for a hybrid camera that is full time pro cinematographer speced and full time pro photographer speced.

Also, why not just use the Q3 for both? You only need like 10.4mp or something to be able to record 4k video... the Q3 is 4k capable, and even when you digital crop to 75mm I think its still over 10mp for stills, so youd have no problem shooting 4k at 28/35/50/75mm on a Q3.

But even aside from the video side, I still dont understand why with an interchangeable lens system in the SL2s, 24mp isnt enough for stills?

Seems like either of the cameras you have now are capable of accomplishing both stills and *""daily life recording""*, which again is why I feel like you are just getting lost in looking at specs, so much so that you dont see that both your Q3 and SL2s are more than capable of accomplishing what you want to do.

lncp6am,AnonymousBromosapien,">I see, Q3 isn‚Äôt enjoyable and it just sits there. So i want to get rid of it.

Ok well see mow thisnis pertinent information that wasnt included that changes the thought process here... lol. So what you really have isnt two cameras that you feel like you have to take out every tiem you go out just to be able to meet your needs... What you have is one paperweight and one camera that you enjoy lol.

I think the obvious answer is yes, selling both and getting an SL3 makes sense in your case now knowing this information. Regarding the idea of waiting for an SL3s... id say that really just comes down to what you prioritize more and your typical filming conditions. If you are prioritizing video over stills then yea, the SL3s might be worth waiting for. But also, if you are only ever really recording in well lit situations then the better lowlight performance pf the SL3s really isnt necessary.

>but I do enjoy printing, so as a preference I wouldn‚Äôt mind the extra megs

For what its worth... 24mp is pretty much suitable enough to print high resolution prints at any size. What is considered *""high res""* whennit comes to prints also comes down to the appropriate viewing distance from the print size. I have 8mp JPEGs captured on a cell phome like a decade ago printed in 13x19 on my wall right now that look great. The reality is, nobody is going to be pixel peeping a 24x36 print from 6 inches away... they are going to biew it from a distance that facilitates them actually being able to take in the image. 

E.g. a 4x6 print is going to be viewed pretty close, so 300ppi is kinda standard for a print that size to be considered a *""high res""* viewing experience. Whereas a billboard requires like 1-4ppi for a high res viewing experience. I.e. its all relative and at a certain point a cameras megapixel count can exceed the actual print capabilities of a photo printer. 

My D850 is 46mp, and when I go to print a 13x19 uncropped image it something between like 750-900ppi at that size... so well above even the 300ppi *standard* for even a 4x6 print and like 4x the size. The point im making with thisnis that my $800 dedicated photo printer is only capable of 300dpi max... So for multiple reasons, when it comes to prints, it doesnt matter that my 46mp D850 can take because even if I were to print large prints the 46mp is already vastly exceeding the printer's capablity anyways.

Outside of all the above... in reading the rest of you comment it really seems like you are just all over the place. Youve got an SL2s and a Q3, you are asking if you should get rid of them both for an SL3 or SL3s for various reasons... then you stating that another option is to keepbthe SL2s and get an M11.... which really doesnt accomplish anything that you stated you were trying to accomplish here lol. 

So honestly idk what you are trying to do at this point, but I even more firmly stand by my original remark that you are getting caught up in specs unnecessarily... with an apparent touch of GAS as well.

Just because seemingly most of the owners are lawyers and dentists who keep theirs as trophies on shelves or don't put them through the punches because they're shooting in auto on vacations doesn't mean that they shouldn't be used in professional settings. 

Of course, it's not my primary camera for weddings. It's just a bit jarring to see folks almost defend the fact that the camera isn't working as it should. This is German engineering; it's like not giving your Porsche the spirited driving it was made for.

The buffer is there for a reason (it's quite sizable), and you shouldn't have to turn off a 6000-dollar camera every few shots because you're worried it will freeze up.

Part go out of stock and machining new parts for very old cameras does not make much financial sense.

But although I really lik mechanical cameras, I also do own an Olympos OM-4 and a Nikon F3 and never had any issues with their electronics. I really do not generally distrust these old, solid electronics. An M7 might last for many more decades. And let us not forget that Leica cannot replace meters of classic M6 and M6TTL anymore (at least at the moment, Leica or somebody might come up with a solution in the future).

All that being said: The M5. I know there are those who dislike it, mostly due to its looks. I have posted on many M5 pages here on Reddit and on other boards, that if we toss all the other Ms in one group of ‚Äûnon-M5 Ms‚Äú and call them the prettiest 35 mm cameras ever built (and that is my opinion), that still might mean that the M5 is the second most pretty 35 mm camera ever built.

Technically speaking: I did own an M6, I do own an M5, as a practical shooter I would not switch back to an M5, because the ergonomics of the M5 are simply better to me. the slightly bigger size makes it more stable in my hands, the large shutter dial lets me adjust it while looking through it and the shutter indicator in the viewfinder allows me to do it understanding what I am doing. the needle meter tells me not only that I am off but also by how far and the meter itself is a really tight meter, almost a spot meter, that allows me to meter different sections of the image. All these points make it a camera far superior to the M6, M6TTL and MP for daily usage in my hands.

These don‚Äôt look like scratches, they‚Äôre too soft. 

Is it just on this one shot? Scanners, as the name implies, work sequentially. Uneven illumination over the time of the scan would cause this. 

It could also be some residue from cleaning the film, which can usually be removed by a decent lab by re-washing it. I still think it‚Äôs the scanner, because residue, like scratches, most often goes the long way across the image, as the film travels through the squeegee at the end of the development process. 

For the record, there are two kinds of scratches: Base side and Emulsion side. Base side scratches show dark on slides, and bright on negative, but you can see the image through them. Emulsion side scratches show bright on slides and dark on negatives. They completely remove the image, as you can imagine they would.

Like many other flash units from that time, you get manual mode, and (non-TTL) auto mode that uses a sensor in the unit itself, cutting off the flash when there is sufficient light with a thyristor circuit. Metz, who made the SF20 for Leica, made similar units under their own branding that you can probably find much more cheaply, as well as more versatile units with proper bounce heads and more power, etc. They don't have Leica's 'film TTL' mode (except for some pro units that could take Leica-specific adapters), but that won't work with the M10 anyway.

ln5avn5,fineYogurtAndBerries,"I own an M10, and an M10-R. Do you plan to shoot mostly JPEG or RAW? JPEG has some limitations on these cameras, but they are found at different spots.

Clipping highlights on the M10 is still something I fall into, occasionally. Even after years of using it, so be prepared to adjust to the M10's quirks (ISO 200 is another). On JPEGs, you will have to compromise when exposing.

The 10-R is much more tolerant in the highlights. On the other hand, noise processing gets iffy in 3200+ ISO JPEGs. It looks strange, and visibly irritating on the back of the screen. You sort of have to trust that the RAW delivers better. I had to adjust my RAW workflow for that camera to deal with the noise but eventually managed it to match my preferences. The noise characteristics are totally different though.

Only seen samples from the M11, but if you are shooting at 6400 ISO and don't want to sweat while post processing, the M11 wins.

Colors:

I can't really describe it, but the original M10 seems a lot closer to the M240 from what I have seen. Never owned the 240 though. M10-R and 11 defnitely have a different color adjustment, with the M11 looking the ""most clinical/modern"" to my eye. The 10-R is actually a pretty sweet spot in the middle here. If you want to take out of cam JPEG and like warmer color tones, go for the original M10.

Resolution-wise, I actually stepped down to 24MP again with the M10 original, coming from a Sony A7RII. I did not miss a lot, but for landscapes, I can see 40MP making sense.

Lens-wise: I find the 35 'lux perfectly capable of handling 40MP at all apertures. Not sure about 60MP, but I've never been pixel-peeping. As long as an image ""makes sense"" to my eye in overall impression, I'm good.

My advice is to search for sample (RAW, high and low ISO) files, and cross-check them with your workflow. That's at least what I did, and was the reason why I opted against the M11. But that is all personal preference.",5,1726348438.0,2024-09-14 21:13:58,,0,1fgqvp4

ln63bra,armevans,"I‚Äôve only owned the M10, but I went through a similar shopping process earlier this year and had the chance to demo the M11, M10, and M240 at a Leica Store and play with files from all three before making my choice. I‚Äôll share my rationale for going for the M10 on the off chance that it‚Äôs helpful.

The M11 would have been a big stretch cost-wise. At the time, the M11 even used seemed to be nearly twice the cost of the M10. It was a lovely camera to hold and use, but the files were larger than I needed (coming from using 40mp and 24mp cameras and generally preferring the files from the 24), and I was worried about reports of issues (which mostly seem to resolved now?). Had I not already had a few M-Mount lenses from shooting with a film M, buying the M11 would have meant I had nearly $0 for lenses, which also would have been a problem.

The M240 was by far the most economical of the options I was able to demo, but despite really liking the files it produced (at least in decent light), I found it to be the least pleasant to use. You owned one, so your experience may differ, but it felt significantly bulkier and less well laid out than the M10/11. Still better than many cameras, but not quite up to par with the later Ms. Had I needed to buy lenses too, I would probably have gone this route to allow a decent budget for good glass.

The M10 offered performance and ergonomic upgrades from the M240, and while it doesn‚Äôt match the M11‚Äôs performance, it produces flexible and nice looking files in a variety of light conditions. I don‚Äôt find myself missing the higher resolution of my previous 40mp body one bit. It is fairly easy to blow out the highlights on the M10, as others have noted, but keeping the exposure compensation at -1/3 or -2/3 tends to avoid that while keeping plenty of detail.

I went for the standard M10 over the P or R variants because I didn‚Äôt find the features of either to be worth the significant price jump. The M10‚Äôs shutter is plenty quiet for my uses, and I don‚Äôt mind the red dot. As noted above, resolution isn‚Äôt a huge priority, and 24mp is fine for me. 

Going with the standard M10 left me with enough budget leftover to expand my lens selection a bit, which made a big difference. Frankly, any of the cameras you‚Äôre considering will be great, so I‚Äôd say you should buy whatever camera allows you to afford the lens(es) you want.",3,1726357737.0,2024-09-14 23:48:57,,0,1fgqvp4
ln9xir6,ceih,"DOI: I went from the M240 to the M11-P, skipping the M10 generation entirely.

From your list, I'd be looking closely at the M10-R or the M11. I can see people talking about the M240/262 and its never ending battery as well, but I honestly wouldn't go back to that era of digital M simply due to the size/bulk and the overall slowness of the cameras. Yes it could give you nice files in good light, but the sensor is showing its age now in my opinion (high ISO in particular).

Moving to an 11-P for me was lovely. Much nicer handling than the M240, and the Visioflex2 EVF is far far superior to the old EVF. The M11 handles the same, obviously, but it'll be very dependent on the price you can find it for.

With the M10 series, I'd take the -R. Higher resolution, lower base ISO and lesser tendency to munge the highlights if you over-expose. Handles better than the M240 for sure from when I've had a play with a few.",1,1726420317.0,2024-09-15 17:11:57,,0,1fgqvp4

lnja556,Witty_Mango3576,"Having owned an M240 for 4 years before moving onto the M10 for the last 6 years, I personally would have skipped the M10 and went straight to an M11 if I could have a do-over.

The M10 is a great camera but there are a few things about it that are showing its age now. If you can stretch the budget, I reckon an M11 is the way to go.

The battery life of the M10 is not great. I bought an extra battery on the day I bought the M10, and will generally have to change batteries on a typical day trip. I don‚Äôt use auto review ever. I used the M240 a lot back then on multi-day hikes and never had to change batteries after a full day. Even accounting for energy improvements in the M10, it‚Äôs 1,100 mAh for the M10 battery vs 1,800 mAh of the M240 battery; that‚Äôs a 64% difference. The M11 has a high capacity battery like the M240.

Also battery-related, the USB-C internal charging capability of the M11 is just convenient. Even if you forget your charger, you can still easily find ways to charge your battery without trying to find a Leica store that has a charger in stock whilst travelling. Plus, you can charge on the go with a battery bank.

Finally, I think the M10‚Äôs sensor is beginning to age. It was miles ahead of the sensor in the M240, but that‚Äôs because the M240 sensor was so limited to begin with, including having really bad banding at high ISO. As many have noted, the M10 sensor can blow highlights and they are impossible to recover. ISO6400 is still quite good but I wouldn‚Äôt like to set ISO beyond that. It‚Äôs not a bad sensor, but with M11, you‚Äôre getting a class-leading sensor that is better in resolution, dynamic range and low light.

At the end of the day, they are all good cameras. I think the M11 will get a better run as your main camera.",1,1726555929.0,2024-09-17 06:52:09,,0,1fgqvp4

- A Squarehood for Summicron V4 can be installed on a V3, but it involves conversion that is *almost permanent*.
- This converted hood may make vignettes at f/4 or larger apertures more apparent, especially when focusing close to infinity. 6 ft and below seem to be unimpacted. For my preferred photo styles and subjects this is not an issue.

In the default configuration, the internal retaining sleeve will be too short to screw into the Summicron V3 (as it is designed for V4/V5).

But if you screw a filter onto the *lens* first, then the sleeve can screw onto the filter's threads. The issue is once you've done this it's almost impossible to take the filter off the sleeve of the Squarehood, so use a quality UV/Skylight that does not have a high resale value. I used a Haida Nano Pro protector that was gathering dust previously (due to interferences with the IROOA hood) but has pretty good multicoating and easy to clean.

ln6pg0k,Conscious-Distance48,"I do own a couple L lenses, but they're not prime lenses. I have a 24-70 F2.8L and a 70-200 F2.8L. I also have some non-L, but considered pretty good prime lenses: 50mm F1.4, 85mm F1.8, and the 100mm F2.8 Macro. My current Canon body is an R6 MkII with the battery portrait grip. Outside of my Canon cameras, I have a Fujifilm X100S that I also liked to use when I travel since it's so small and really still an excellent camera.

I still feel Canon cameras are excellent and have their place. I still use it for sports photography, automotive photography, and astrophotography. For everything else, I use the Q3 and unfortunately never the Fujifilm anymore (hey, it's 10 years old now).

Switching to the Q cameras isn't really a giant leap from a DSLR (albeit without interchangeable lenses) in terms of how I go about getting the shot. I still use autofocus and 98% of my shots are taken in aperture priority and I always shoot in raw.

I don't believe there is a magic ""Leica Look"" like some do, but the insanely sharp lens paired with 60 MP is fantastic! The DNGs are super flexible allowing me to tailor the image to my taste. I would say most of my editing style is to make the image match what I see in my mind's eye with maybe a little bit of artistic license.

The camera is built like a tank, a lot more substantial than my mid-level Canon, and I just love using it. I take it with me many places and it's not conspicuous because of its relatively small size and dark color.

When I get an M11, I'll still keep the Q3 as if feel they're fairly different and I may want to use them in different situations. I've still never used a rangefinder so we'll see.

I didn't want to take my camera(s) on holiday because lugging the bag around got annoying, and it's also incredibly annoying for family when you're whipping out a massive white lens to take some ""snaps"". Sure I could get nice images, even on ""old"" equipment (5DM2/M3), but I was just weary with the whole thing.

So in came M, and the size/portability is far better. I'm back to taking photos for enjoyment and also not being ""the camera weirdo"". Sure some people clock that I'm carrying an expensive camera, but they generally just want a chat rather than anything else, and others just ignore it entirely and carry on. My kit is now a single small shoulder bag, and I can take a digital and a film body along easily.

The Z and SL2 setups were with musicals/ dances/sports days, but I could see it kinda... gave a few parents some pressure.

ln9bqpu,mrjosh72,"For most things I use a digital M with 28, 50, 90, and 135. I find M photography fun, even relaxing, and so have been doing everything with Ms only for a while now. But I recently picked up an SL2-S with 24-70 and 70-200 for kids‚Äô sports and performances. 

I‚Äôve only had the SL cam for about six weeks, and I‚Äôm still learning the ropes with it compared to the Ms, with which I‚Äôm really proficient. After an initial period of awkwardness I think I‚Äôm seeing how valuable it can be to mix it in with my Ms. Sometimes I put the long M lenses on the SL2-S and keep the wide lenses on the M for a two body solution. My preference is to use the small M system whenever possible, because it‚Äôs more discreet and more fun for me. So I have only been bringing out the SL and big zooms for outdoor field sports like soccer. The size of the gear makes me conspicuous, but I share the pictures with other parents when it makes sense. Yesterday the coach asked me to take a posed team photo, and it came out well! So having the bigger kit has made me take on a more visible role as the Photo Dad. 

Overall, I‚Äôm finding that this kit is giving me a lot of options in terms of AF / MF, focal length, and big vs. small setups. That said, I think it‚Äôs certainly possible to do everything with an M, and I may go back to that eventually. The SL system is a lot of bulk and weight. But I‚Äôve been getting some photos with it that I never could‚Äôve gotten using only the M system. I think it‚Äôll be a question of whether those pictures are worth the investment and effort. And also of how much sports and performance becomes a meaningful part of my kid‚Äôs life that I really want to capture, instead of just a thing we do from time to time.",2,1726413432.0,2024-09-15 15:17:12,,0,1fh9c4p

Sure you can do a lot with an m10/11 and a 50 / 90 / 135 but you‚Äôre making it hard for yourself. If you can afford it I‚Äôd buy a new system just for school events. It‚Äôs your kid and if you want to capture these special moments use the same gear wedding photographers do, who are also in similar poorly lit environments with no do overs.

lnb8zce,vxxn,"Pretty much all electronics depreciate, but the most rapid depreciation takes place when you buy a brand new camera. We can model this decline in price as an exponential relationship like

p = p0\*(1-r)\^t

where p is current value, p0 is initial value, r is the annual rate of depreciation, and t is time in years.

We can plugin values we know for the M240 to solve for r, the depreciation rate. M240 launch pricing was $7k and now sells for like \~$2k (sometimes more, sometimes less depending on condition) after 12 years. We could solve this very precisely with better data, but for back of the envelope we see the value declines about 10% per year.

Plugging into the equation to check, we see the math works pretty well with the 10% annual decay rate:

7000\*(1-0.1)\^12 = 1977 \~= 2000

What this means for the used Leica purchaser is that if you buy a used M240 today for $2k and want to sell it a year later, you will probably recoup 90% of the purchase price less any selling fees if using platforms like eBay. The value is forecast to drop \~$200 this year, or $16/month. From this cost of ownership perspective, Leica seems like great value.

When people say Leica's ""hold their value"", they don't mean they don't depreciate over time. But that the depreciation curve is much more forgiving compared to other brands. Lookup what Nikon cameras from 12 years ago are sold for today. The Nikon D4 launched in 2012 for $6k and now regularly sell for \~$400... equivalent to 20% annual depreciation.",1,1726434870.0,2024-09-15 21:14:30,,0,1fh1o0h

lncc07q,vxxn,"I was clear that my model is just an estimate. The conclusion is that you minimize your cost of ownership by purchasing pre-owned cameras that are still useful despite being heavily depreciated compared to what they cost new.

What's your alternative? Every camera depreciates. Probably you're right the initial depreciation is even steeper, but as I wasn't recommending a new camera purchase I didn't go into detail on that. Sounds like you're saying we should never buy any digital M because it might lose value?

>I go back to my initial points. There‚Äôs nothing inherently valuable about the 240 and all subsequent digital M releases will just push the prices further and further down.

The M240 was and is already a good camera. It shoots 24 megapixels and is extremely usable today as long as you don't need extreme low light performance from the sensor. For people on a budget who want a rangefinder experience, this is still attractive.

>There is always going to be downwards pricing pressure from the latest models that will always be technically better in every way.

The used market for M10-R would like a word. Newer is not always better. You can find used M11 bodies all day long, and M10-R bodies are scarce as hen's teeth. And given the basic formula for a rangefinder is not open to change, there's really not a ton of high value features left to add unless they can figure out how to fit IBIS in there.

In any event, it sounds like the real question here is whether a Q3 is a worthy ‚Äùupgrade‚Äù over your X100VI. And for that question, I think you can look to your experience shooting the Q2. The Q3 has some nice upgrades over the Q2, but in terms of the overall shooting experience and image quality relative to the X100 series, the Q2 is a close enough proxy. 

At the end of the day, the Leica is larger and heavier‚Äîand quite a bit more expensive‚Äîbut in exchange for that, you get a larger sensor and a faster and wider lens, among a few other nice-to-haves. I‚Äôve not shot the Q3, but I have owned a Q and a Q2M as well as the Fuji X100 series. On the whole, I find the Q to be a much nicer shooting experience. It‚Äôs a truly premium camera with a fantastic lens that has a particularly nice manual focusing experience. It‚Äôs just a joy to shoot.

That said, I also prefer 35mm to 28mm (more like 26mm, with the Q), and I do care about size and weight on my fixed-lens cameras. In other words, a lot of this comes down to personal preference. The only way to know for sure is to try it for yourself. If you purchase from a reputable retailer with a decent return policy, then you can shoot it a bunch when you get it to see if it‚Äôs a good fit for you (or keep it a bit longer, as you should be able to resell it without much of a loss).",2,1726316501.0,2024-09-14 12:21:41,,0,1fgk8v9
ln2t4to,cqprime,"Previously I owned Q2 and regretted selling it off. I got back into leica via Q3. Q3 image quality is awesome. If you plan to move to Q3 you won‚Äôt look back. As for Fuji, I had a FUji xT5 and it was great with film simulation. But I sold it away after I got Q3 and never look back.

For battery, I always get spare battery as direct charging to my camera I worry the power surge might damaged my camera mainboard. My personal fear.

ln3dzsc,Andy_Shields,Don't overthink the exposure. Set the camera to the sync speed or lower. Set the aperture to give you a forgiving amount of dof but open enough to still let some light in like f5.6. Shoot at casual distances no closer than an arms length and no further away than you'd use a standard speaking voice. The latitude for overexposure will bail you out if it's a little too bright.

ln3ho8h,nnntom,"the flash will fire at any speed, but it will only sync correctly (meaning you will have every portion of the frame covered by the beam) at 1/50 or slower. you can play with slower speeds to get a shutter drag effect.

the way i found ideal settings for a couple of dumb flashes (that only have one or two power output settings) is by placing them on a digital camera.

choose a desired iso (of the film you plan on shooting), set the same 1/50 sync speed and by adjusting the aperture, you will find the range of the flash.

for example, i know that at full power output, my dumb Panasonic flash will yield good results like this:

iso400, 1/50, f/11 for when subject is at 1 meter. iso400, 1/50, f8 for when subject is at 2 meters.

and so on. adjust the aperture depending on the distance to your subject. when in doubt, overexpose by opening the aperture.

ln3jjyc,Raptor470,"From one M6 owner to another:  
M6 was my dream camera during uni time and after 20 years I got one from a local shop as a collector sold this to them.

I started with the lenses Voigtlander Nokton 35mm f1/.4 M.C. VM II and the Voigtlander Nokton 50mm f/1.2 VM.

* The Voigtlander Nokton 35mm f1/.4 M.C. VM II is great! If you need the speed and want some vintage/oldschool rendering shoot it wide open. Stop it down and it is characteristic changes to a good sharp lens without glow. The lens is still small, compact, not heavy and don't change the balance to front heavy when mounted to the M camera.
* If you don't need the speed and you always use the lens stopped down get the Voigtlander 35mm with smaller aperture. Follow the recommendations from the other redditors in the comments.
* There is the Leica Elmarit 28mm f/2.8, Leica Summicron 28mm f/2.0, Typoch Semira 28mm f/1.4 and Voigtlander  Ultron 28mm 2.0 ASPH. VM Type I and Type II. The latter one with the difference of Type I and Type II is the appearance, weight and focusing lever. I own the Type II and this lens is sharp to the corners and from edge to edge. Best lens, sharper, smaller, compact, not front heavy and much cheaper than Leica's offering with the Summicron version. Also

If you want to stay in the f/2.0 wide open aperture territory you have to look into whaat you want and choose between Leica Summicron 28mm and Voigtlander Ultron 28mm.

People who get the brighter lenses like the Summilux 28mm, Typoch 28mm f/1.4 are over the moon with it but they hate the weight and size. The opportunities you can shoot with such wide open aperture lenses are great. However most of them will switch over to more smaller, lighter, compact lenses: Mostly the Elmarit 28mm f/2.8 or Voigtlander Ultron 28mm f/2.0. Why not straight to the Ultron you may ask? Those people tried both lenses and they either prefer the rendering of the Elmarit or want to stay in the same Leica ecosystem (brand, handling of the lens, lens exterior design, focus ring, aperture ring, aesthetics etc.) and buy the Leica lens instead from a third-party.

I love my Voigtlander Nokton 50mm f/1.2 VM and its rendering for portraits but that thing is a tank. I can't imagine to own the f/1.0 version because that lens is much beefier. I was fed up with the size and weight on travels. When I use it for portraits with locals, strangers or friends on the travels you have to carry the heavy lens with you. When the sun is out and bright either you have to use the lens with a ND filter to take photos wide open or you need to stop down. The latter one if you want to have from the nose tip to the ears everything sharp & in focus (usually I stop down to f/2 and smaller in third stops down to f/2.8 the max smallest).  
That is the reason why I got the Leica Summicron 50mm f/2 v4 first and after a while the v5.  
Now I am rocking the Light Lens Lab Elcan 50mm f/2 replica which is an amazing lens with its characteristic lens rendering. The pre-aspherical lens rendering wide open aperture is a delight to see when taking portraits. Stopped down it is like a Summicron lens.  
I also own a Voigtlander 50mm f/2 APO for my Sony camera. It is awesome and the APO perfect rendering is amazing but the size and weight is not worth it. After all the years of shooting on different lenses I prefer the lens which has some flaws - the famous words 'lens character', is compact and light.

You have to sit down and ask yourself what are your needs and requirements for a lens. What do you like to see in a photo? After you have your answers to those questions you can pick the right lens for you.",2,1726328656.0,2024-09-14 15:44:16,,0,1fgbj6k

And because of that composure and subject matter will make or break your photos. The 28mm will also reward you big time if you‚Äôre able to get real close to the subject because of the detail you‚Äôll be able to capture. 

The 28mm is close to the focal length of a mobile phone lens. So a lot of the times a vertical snap on the 28mm will feel iPhoney. But its familiarity can be a comfort whereas a 35mm or 50mm can be a new adventure to go on.

ln3tbop,sockpoppit,"The basic parts are about $800 or so retail, then count the ephemera stuff as bonus. That's a reasonable price, not cheap, and one of the better LTM Leica cameras, if that's what you're into. You may or may not have to throw some money at the body, and the coatings on that particular lens are soft, as is the glass, so they tend towards scratching if abused at all, so buying without seeing wouldn't be something I'd do. Bodies like that can go on forever without a CLA if treated well but the lens may need internal cleaning.

The body is a IIIf, not a IIIc to go with the instructions, but there are several variations of that camera. The lens a 50 mm f/2 collapsible Summicron. The left front lens a 90/4 elmar, which is a great lens, actually, and on the reflex housing is a 135/4.5 Hektor. Visoflex I with chimney finder. I think I see a finder for either the 90 or 135 in the case lid... probably for the 90.

It's a great user as that type of thing goes. If you scorn things that don't have the latest whiz-bang (and I'm feeling a lot of that from other posts) you won't be happy. If the best 1950 had to offer is something that you think you can work with, it will work. The lenses are still fundamentally good ones, and the 50 is an actual classic. I've had four of them over the years and one is still one of my primary lenses for my M4s. And I keep a 90/4 at my shop for grab shots there.

lmz687h,RWilsonL,"Be very careful about buy an original M6, particularly the TTL model. They both use electronics on a 1990's vintage printed circuit board. These have become a bit notorious for failing, particularly the TTL. My M6 TTL failed after a trip to stay with my wife's sister in Barbados in 2002 where it was very humid during our stay. I had the board replaced but was warned even as far back as that, that supplies of the replacement board were limited and they ran out a few years later. The suggestion is that the flux was poorly cleaned off these boards and in humid conditions this corrodes the tracks on the card. What I don't know but have been trying to find out is if the circuit board of the reissued M6 is compatible with the original pre-TTL models. Nobody seems to know or are saying if they do.

lmu6n7k,WigglyDan,"As someone who just bought a Leica, I would actually advise against buying either the new Leica MP or the reissued M6. Essentially, they are the same camera, with only minor differences like the paint job, the advance lever style, and the rewind knob.

If you're looking for a camera to slow down and truly enjoy the shooting process, I'd recommend the MP. However, if you're more focused on the aesthetic or ""clout,"" the M6 might be more your style.

Personally, if you're buying new, I would suggest going with the Leica M-A. The build quality is technically superior, particularly with the all-metal film reminder back plate, as opposed to the plastic ones on both the MP and M6. Metal is more durable over time.

But the main reason to choose the M-A is that it doesn‚Äôt have a built-in light meter. Light meters degrade over time‚Äîtypically within 10 to 20 years‚Äîso it makes sense to get a simple external meter instead. I'd recommend something like the Keks or Astihori. I own both, and I find the Keks easier to use and more accurate. Plus, when the external meter eventually needs replacing, you can easily swap it out without affecting your camera.",1,1726179569.0,2024-09-12 22:19:29,,0,1ffbg4l
lmtnapg,huff65535,"I love the black paint on any models and adore my m10-r black paint.  Side by m10 BP and MP BP just look so sweet together (analog / digital pair).

So if you love the brassed look putting your own photo journey brassing (like getting a chip or a rub from travels) you‚Äôll remember fondly where you got your brass marks with fond memories ü•∞

But M6 finish if you want harder wearing finish that is way harder to brass (or silver brass vs gold color) on then maybe M6 for you.

Or best of both worlds, brass your MP, and after brassing sets in and you don‚Äôt like it you can have it repainted ‚Ä¶which is a much more difficult process on the black finish models.

I truly love that the only specifically approved-of camera in this rant is the one in the lineup that‚Äôs almost universally considered a *Leica in style points only.*¬†¬† ¬†

There‚Äôs been a stylised cachet to the brand for over half a century, and honestly if you want them to keep existing they‚Äôve got to have some revenue stream beyond grumpy purists. Nikon, Canon and Fujifilm sustain their enthusiast businesses with immense foundations as general optics & imaging companies. Sony is an absolute electronics giant. Of those four, only Fujifilm arguably lacks a clear base of working sports/wedding/etc pros for revenue as well.¬†¬†¬†

Leica has essentially none of that, save for some industrial optics, but what it does have is unbelievably strong luxury brand value. Look at what it can charge for a fixed lens hobby/family camera in the Q series. Yes it‚Äôs genuinely a great line of cameras, but leica optics aren‚Äôt the only reason it has essentially no competitors. The Sony RX1Rmkii was a flawed but really fantastic camera, but only Leica seems to have the special allure to sell a product in that bracket. Without exploiting that market position & selling to those ‚Äòhipster & entertainment types‚Äô I‚Äôm just not sure a business based around Ms & lenses could survive.

ln414xw,Bryceybryce,"So preface to say that I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree but I think you‚Äôre grossly overestimating the cost implications. 

First, as a counterpoint to your points about Apple, I would posit that Apple does offer an experience, ecosystem, and lifecycle distinct from what Android flagships offer. Android to iOS is simply not apples to apples. Apple does enjoy a healthy margin, but this margin is not so great as to change the price by multiples. We‚Äôre talking a 10-15% advantage over something like Samsung galaxy phones. This margin is arguably more a function of monopolistic pricing (there is no direct iOS competition, there are many many many Android competitors) than marketing. If Samsung had no competition for Android, they would arrest similar premiums. 

For Leica, again I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree with you but comparing them to Apple is not a very good comparison. Apple is not a lifestyle brand in the same way that luxury retailers are. Last I checked Apple was still predominantly selling hardware and software, not photo books and keyrings. 

Leica on the other hand d spends an inordinate amount money on advertising and brand image work and employ luxury product strategies, which includes cheap, non-core items to allow people to access the brand at a lower entry point. See for example the key rings, the shutter buttons, the photo books, the apparel, and perhaps most egregiously of all exercises in branding like the Dlux. They aren‚Äôt a public company so this is a bit outside baseball, but their gross profit margins on the m11 are estimated to be ~50-60% and net profit to be 10-20%. Sony full frame cameras are estimated to have a gross margin of 35%-40% with a net of 10-20% as a comparison. These are estimates so take with a grain of salt but what this is saying is that yes Leica is charging a luxury tax on top of its monopolistic pricing (this is distinct from Apple in my opinion since they exhibit the behaviors of a monopolist but not so much an ultra luxury company like Leica or Ferrari etc). But, since their net margins are likely similar to Sony‚Äôs, they‚Äôre effectively funneling back ‚Äúextra‚Äù profit from their luxury pricing into their marketing and brand positioning activities. 

So what does this all mean? Leica exhibits both monopolistic and luxury retail behaviors. They won the range finder wars and thus won the ability to profit from their monopoly - nothing anyone can do about that unless pixii actually make a competitive product. However, beyond that they are engaging in luxury practices. This is the second driver of ‚Äúinflated‚Äù pricing compared to their competition. However, this does not inflate the price of the cameras as much as you would think. There‚Äôs really only a 15-20% gross margin difference between them and someone like Sony. What this means is that ignoring both their monopolistic position and their luxury marketing practices, the $9000 m11 is really more like a $7.5k - $8k camera if Leica were having to more directly compete with other camera manufacturers. Is it overpriced? It‚Äôs apples to oranges. However, the Leica investment in their brand is maybe adding on $1k or so to the purchase price. This is not insignificant, but it also isn‚Äôt a multiple of 2 or something over what they would be charging in a more competitive environment. The camera would still be wildly expensive and out of reach for most people with or without Leica‚Äôs marketing expense.",7,1726334223.0,2024-09-14 17:17:03,,0,1fgptsl

Apple makes the best hardware for creatives out there. I‚Äôd pit my m3 MacBook Pro against anything else for actual creative work. Was it pricey? Sure but not that pricey compared to the spec for spec competition. 

Patek is a luxury brand, no doubt (who really needs a watch these days?) but they are definitely among the most well respected watchmakers in the history of horology and their current offerings, while unobtainium, are in anyone‚Äôs shortlist of best watches. 

Leica takes a similar approach to their field. Expensive but top of the line cameras and glass. Yes, they make baubles, too, but that doesn‚Äôt take away from their hardware. Name one camera line of theirs that isn‚Äôt considered among the best in that particular area. (Let‚Äôs leave the d lux out of the convo because it‚Äôs the one camera they make that is actually price competitive with its peers and mostly not really a Leica.)

I shoot with a Leica because I want a rangefinder. I want a modern rangefinder - high resolution, WiFi, location tagging, integration with my smartphone, USB-C. All of it. I want to use top of the line glass and vintage gems. What other options are there for me?

So don‚Äôt blame the marketing, influencers and lifestyle buyers. If anything they have opened up Leica to people who will otherwise not buy a Leica. In fact they are keeping the brand strong since it has been proven in history that photographers alone cannot keep the brand afloat.

ln4cm60,F0urrings,"This is all incorrect. You‚Äôre looking at it through a confirmation bias that Apples value proposition (and thus companies like Leica) are all based on the assumption that ‚Äúthey do nothing better, and are for show‚Äù.

Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúdifferentiator‚Äù is a marriage of hardware and software design built by the same people to create an ease-of-use experience that is uniquely good (I have a Pixel 8, I‚Äôm not an Apple-only zealot). They also have a very high performance per watt advantage with their custom silicon as well as have excellent hardware engineering (95% of windows laptops are not built ‚Äúas well‚Äù from a hardware standpoint.)

Leica is not like ‚ÄúPrada‚Äù. A Prada bag does the EXACT same thing a cheaper brand bag does functionally however you pay for 1) better craftsmanship (sometimes), but largely ‚Äúpride of ownership‚Äù or being able to purchase something others cannot. That is the main differentiator between say a cheaper bag or even a ‚Äúknockoff‚Äù.

Leica, like Apple, puts a lot of time into the engineering of their products. They aren‚Äôt as mass produced and they have a higher attention to detail and quality control. They also make excellent lenses. The 60mp sensor in these latest generation of cameras is excellent, and that brings us to the main value proposition of Leica digitals and that is the experience and how it all ties together into a platform that ‚Äúgets out of the way‚Äù while you take photos.

ln6qwin,dwightshairdresser,"That's totally ok but I still think that you're unfairly attacking Leica and the user base. Leica makes really great stuff today, I would argue that some of their stuff is better then ever and if you did your research, you would know that there are plenty of photographers who both use Leica and know what they're doing. 

Like take the SL system for example: these cameras rival the flagship mirrorless models of all the japanese brands. They don't always have exactly matching features when you compare very specific stuff like autofocus speed, because Leica is still a way smaller company that lacks some of the resources of big tech firms like Sony, but when it comes to the overall user experience, the build quality, ergonomics, customizability, robustness, etc. a Leica is worth every single penny that you pay more for it. And there are even some super specific technical things that Leica does way better than these companies that are ten or a hundred times bigger, like the App, for example. Leicas PHOTOS App is easy to use and works relatively reliably while Nikon's app is still an absolute nightmare and I have heard very bad things about almost any camera brand's apps besides from Hasselblad's app which seems to be an even smoother experience. Also, the APO-Summicron-SL lenses are probably among the sharpest lenses in existence, that's not an exaggeration. 
An SL3 is the perfect mirrorless workhorse for any professional photographer who a) has the money, b) doesn't have some very niche requirement like needing the absolute fastest of the fastest autofocus speeds for high-end sports photography or something like that and c) hasn't even weaker wrists than I have.
The fact that there are people whose Leicas serve them more as fashion accessories doesn't negate that and this was also the case in the past, rich hobbyists were always a target demographic for Leica, which is why I got to inherit some Leicas from my grandpa that (along with my modern Leicas) now serve me well as a ""professional"" (whether I know what I'm doing is not for me to decide lol [but my teachers and professors at uni seem to like what I do, so... ])",3,1726367181.0,2024-09-15 02:26:21,,0,1fgptsl

I've been using Macs since the 80s and have dismantled both Macs and Windows machines, and nothing beats the UX of a Mac for hard-core graphic design and photo editing. Leica is exactly the same in the sense that they control the design very, very well and produce a much better experience and much better quality within the areas they excel. They aren't products designed for people who want plug-and-play, assembly-line experiences or absolute adaptability, and that is their strength.

I will stipulate, without reservation, that Apple holding the line on massive GUI changes has been one of its greatest virtues.  Windows is maddening (in so many ways) because of the neverending fiddling they do with the user interface.  So, to that extent, I agree that they've created a more reliable and consistent user experience not unlike what Leica has done.

And that - like Apple - has been Leica's greatest strength.  The RF experience, at least, is largely consistent from a 1961 M2 through a current production M6, and presumably with the M11.  

I just find the pretense and glitter that surrounds the brand today ... entertaining.  Never in my wildest dreams in 1975-ish when I bought a used IIIf, did I imagine I was entering a wormhole that would end up sharing space with $1000 womens' shoes and $100K watches so that the purchaser can be made to feel they are the center of attention.  This is no way undermines the people using these cameras for their intended utility.  At least they *have* a utility unlike the aforementioned shoes and watches.

I've not been ""run out of the room"" so far as I am aware.

ln5b5rm,HorkusSnorkus,"OK, Mr. Pedantic - they are comparable *in function and performance*.  The specific bits may be different but they do more-or-less the same thing and the Apple Faithful (tm) claims notwithstanding, there is nothing particularly special about their hardware.

I say this having torn into dozens of machines of all kinds from data center servers to desktops to laptops.  The Apple hardware just isn't that special.

Oh, and that OS?  The kernel was built on FreeBSD and the microkernel hosting on Mach.  Only the Aqua UI is arguably theirs.  Arguably, because most of those ideas got ""borrowed"" from the PARC work done long before Jobs and Wozniak were stealing parts from HP to create Apple.

So, let's see.  The Apple mystique is built on parts they stole from HP, ideas the pirated from PARC, an operating system whose roots are from AT&T Bell Labs, a microkernel from CMU... so, what exactly is the Apple magic sauce?    Oh, I know!  You get to use the final integrated product but only their way.  No convenient loading of media without their horrific iTunes family of stuff.  Messaging that locks you into the iEverything universe, and now - tada! - custom silicon thereby going in the exact opposite direction personal computing has been going for decades.

The real magic of Apple was that Steve Jobs was a jerk and people mistook that for genius.  Woz was the genius.  Jobs was just the mouth in front if it all.  And - credit where due - he figured out how to peddle this stuff to the masses.  It's just that Kildall, Gates, and Radio Shack did it bigger and earlier than Jobs ever did.  Had Gates not bailed them out by putting the office suite on Macs, Apple would likely have always been a niche player.

Interestingly, what has given new life to Macs in corporate America has been their relatively lower exposure to cyber attacks.  But that has nothing much to do with Apple.  It has to do with the brilliant architecture of Unix as expressed in FreeBSD. 

But I do so love their stock.  It makes me money because there are so many Apple Faithful (tm) who want to send it to me.

If the size of the digital back systems is prohibitive then the X2D. Color is better with Hassy, my personal favorite color science by far. Phocus is a pain but for Hassy files really does provide the best starting point. 

Leaf shutters are tremendously useful compared to the middling 1/125 sync of a GFX and the ergonomics + UI are superior. GFX has the edge in focus but medium format and fast autofocus are mutually exclusive no matter what the marketing people say. If you're in a situation where single point AF is insufficient you're better off with a full frame with proper fast AF then trying to force medium format.

Color files SOOC are better on the Hasselblad as well, but like others have been saying, it‚Äôs not anything you can‚Äôt do with a little work in post with Fuji files.

Adapting lenses is also kind of annoying on the hassy due to the lack of a mechanical shutter, but that‚Äôs the trade off for the leaf shutter. You can only use the electronic shutter which is just about unusable in most conditions without a tripod.

lmwbpun,Corinus,"Actually DoF does decrease when you crop assuming that you are enlarging the crop area to be the same dimensions as the original photo and that you are viewing the enlarged image from the same distance.

There is only one distance that is in perfect focus, all other distances are out of focus. The points that are out of focus near the true focus point have a degree of blur, the ""Circle of Confusion"". When you crop and then enlarge to the original size these Circles of Confusion are increased, so the points that were acceptably out of focus may no longer be acceptable.

You can see this when you zoom into an image when editing it and suddenly that flower petal doesn't look as sharp as you thought it was.

**Aperture Equivalence**

As far as Aperture is concerned you can work out the equivalent aperture when you crop as follows:

A(eq) = Crop/Original\_Focal\_Length \* Lens\_Aperture

E.g. On a 28mm lens with a 50mm crop and f3.2

A(eq) = 50/28 \* f3.2 = f5.7",2,1726214945.0,2024-09-13 08:09:05,,0,1ffoetp

That's for you to decide, if you're a 50mm person I think buying a q3 to shoot everything cropped to that extent isn't a good idea.

lmujwkq,Marlowe426,"I have a relatively new Q3 and had a similar question recently when I saw the feature.  Seems useful but not foolproof. I got the following answer from Perplexity AI:

Based on the information available, here are the details about the Copyright Information feature in the Leica Q3:

The Copyright Information section in the Camera Information menu allows you to add two types of text:

1. Information text: This is typically used for the copyright notice or statement. For example, you might enter something like ‚Äú¬© 2024 All Rights Reserved‚Äù or ‚ÄúCopyright 2024 [Your Name/Company]‚Äù.

2. Artist text: This is meant for the photographer‚Äôs or creator‚Äôs name. You would enter your name or the name of the person taking the photos here.

The Copyright Information is not stored as a visible watermark on the image itself. Instead, it is embedded in the metadata of the image file[3]. This means:

- It does not appear visibly on the photograph
- It is stored within the file‚Äôs EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) data
- It can be viewed using image editing software or file information tools
- It travels with the image file when transferred or shared

The purpose of this feature is to embed ownership and copyright information directly into the image files as they are captured. This can help protect your intellectual property rights and provide attribution information for your photos.

It‚Äôs worth noting that while this information is embedded in the file, it can potentially be removed or altered by someone with the right software tools. Therefore, it should not be considered an absolute protection against unauthorized use, but rather an additional layer of copyright identification for your images.",1,1726184533.0,2024-09-12 23:42:13,,0,1fffthx

The reflection of the secondary mirror and the spider can be seen in the mirror on the right hand side. This reflects back the light back into the telescope.   
  
If it is an autocollimation test then there will be a small light very slightly off axis which will be imaged by the system.

lmrdbbl,iskosalminen,"I've been also looking at 21mm lenses recently. I've been looking at the Super-Elmar 21/3.4f lens (called *""LEICA's best ultrawide lens ever made at any price""* [here](https://www.kenrockwell.com/leica/21mm-f34-asph.htm)).

I was obviously looking at the Lux to go with my 35mm Lux, but it sticks out pretty far and blocks part of the rangefinders view, it's heavy and big, and the price. Nothing I read about the 2.8f was justifying the price.

I live in a country with large parts of the year with very little light so the 1.4 or 2.8 would make sense, but shooting that wide open with 21mm lens isn't really needed most of the time. And to get any bokeh, you'd need to shoot at object at the 70cm range and I just don't do it often enough.

I'm more likely using the 21mm for city- or landscapes and using something between 5.6f and 11f. So, the smaller, cheaper, really sharp 21mm/3.4f lens so far on paper makes most sense to me.

But please let us know which one you end up picking and how you liked it! I would love to hear your comments as I ""have"" to do this same decision around January/February.",5,1726146409.0,2024-09-12 13:06:49,,0,1ff0h9k

Here are some thoughts..  I have a 20mm F1.8 Sigma for my Pentax camera and I do shoot it wide open.  It is a macro lens. so it can take nice flower photos.   Ultimately, I don't use it much since it is kind of an effects lens.  When you shoot it wide open the photos are often soft and dreamy..   So if I take it on a hike, though I don't need a tripod; I am not really happy with the photos I get.  It would probably be better to take a tripod and might as well have a smaller lens then.

The Lux 21mm (though I don't own it) seems like it is kind of soft wide open as well, so if you want sharp photos you might as well get a slower lens.    If you want to use it for indoor portraits, that may be good.  It is hard to get good portraits with a 21mm.  It would be a fun lens, but I don't know if it is worth such a high price.

Come on man... what are you doing with yourself lol.

Edit:

Im just gonna lay this out for you because I feel like you need the help...

You bought this for $2,000, after paid taxes *(7%?)* thats like $2,140 total. Q2s are going for like $3,300... which means even with this thing in pristine condition you arent selling it for much more than you bought it for.

Say you are able to sell it for $2,600... to do so you are 100% going to have to sell it on ebay to get close to that price. That means you are paying ebay's 13% fee. So $2,600 sales price less $338 *(13% ebay fee)* puts you at $2,262. Less the $2,140 you bought it for, that puts you at a whopping $122 in profit...

Now you want to go buy a Q2... at $3,300 plus sales tax of around $231, less your profit on the Q sale that puts your bank account at -$3,409 after buying a Q, flipping it for a cool $122 profit, then buying a Q2.

>You forgot that I could get $1700 for the X100vi if I sold it to MPB.

>I would still have $3600

*""Forgot""*? Dude I dont know you lol idk anything about your X100VI and how that plays into this situation... But assuming you paid MSRP for the X100VI + tax + shipping..  that puts you at around -$1,700. Then including the purchase of the Q + tax + shipping that puts you at around another -$2,200. So as of right now you have two cameras and $3,900 LESS than you would have had if you didnt buy those 2 cameras. Meaning even if break even on selling both of those cameras all you have accomplished was getting yourself back to $0. You didnt make $3,600 or $3,900 or whatever... you just got yourself abck to zero.

I.e. You sell both of those cameras and buy a Q2... you are still -$3,600 in the hole and the only thing youve accomplished is having one less camera.

To which I would respond again... what are you doing with yourself? You admittedly dont have any money... you, seemingly, very impulsively bought two cameras within a two week period that you cant afford... and now you want to know
If you should offload both of them and probably lose money overall just to go and spend that money that you dont have on another camera?

Like what even is that decision making process? What I think you should do is sell both the Q and X100VI and cross your finger that you break even after all these bad decisions and then lock up your credit/debit card and stay off of ebay for a while lol. I dont think ive ever once seen someone as recklessly as you just buy random cameras they cant afford for no rhyme or reason all the while being completely unsure of why they want them or why they even bought them in the first place. 

Like seriously... youve spent probably about $4,500 in the past two weeks on cameras and the day the second one comes in you are asking strangers on reddit if you should upgrade to a different camera? Surely you can acknowledge how wild that is lol.

I guarantee you that if you buy a camera right now with your current mindset, you will be buying a $6000 to $12000 dollar paperweight.

You wouldn't be the first person to do this, nor would you be the last.  It's almost cliche at this point.

Instead, find out if you are actually interested in photography.  Go to your nearby university or community college and take a photography class.  Ask the professor/instructor what equipment you need to buy in order to be successful in the class, and follow their recommendations.  I guarantee it won't be a Leica.

lmsfgqe,Sagebrush_Sky,"It's hard to tell what you find enticing about Leica. I would offer this - if you want a video-capable digital camera that's going to take you in a different direction than the things that make Leica an interesting system for some. The film rangefinder or equivalent M digital body, with few bells or whistles, is all about using zone focusing to capture things as they unfold for journalistic or artistic purposes. The main advantages of the rangefinder over the SLR in this instance being that 1) you can see outside the framelines that you are shooting so you can anticipate action somewhat better and 2) the absence of a mirror means you an shoot at much lower shutter speeds without blur. That's a manual focus, bare-bones kind of machine that is elegant in its way. I encourage you to try it out, as others have said a Canon 7 is a good approximation because it is also a manual focus rangefinder film camera. That said if you want video capability that seems to take you in another direction. Why not get a cheap old film rangender and a different digital rig for video?",2,1726159226.0,2024-09-12 16:40:26,,0,1ff5co0

lmtgjul,SchnuufePhoto,"I love Leica and have a couple of Ms. However if you are new and just getting into photography I would highly recommend not to spend this big amount of money as you might find out that you don‚Äôt like it. Get something cheaper with exchangeable lenses. Honestly for just a decent Leica body you could buy a Fuji / Canon / Nikon / Sony with a couple of nice lenses. You will need to learn your preferences first for what kind of lenses (focal lengths) you like, what kind of controls you prefer etc. 

Also if you get into Leica sooner or later you want to get an M camera, but rangefinders are not for everyone. I would recommend as a beginner to get a mirrorless with live view out of the box which makes it much easier for you to see and learn exposure. I would also not recommend a Q here as many other do as 28mm as a beginner can be very hard to compose and fill the frame properly. 

My personal opinion - if you like the Leica aesthetic probably try out Fuji. They are not really rangefinders or anything but somehow for me Fuji X bodies at least the ones with dedicated shutter / iso dials paired with the aperture ring on the lenses always give me similar vibe / inspiration as Leicas do.",2,1726171007.0,2024-09-12 19:56:47,,0,1ff5co0

If you‚Äôre looking for a manual-ish camera with video capabilities, I‚Äôd definitely recommend a Fuji in the XH line, or like some others have suggested, a LUMIX with some Leica glass. There have even been some rumors, probably horse shit rumors, that Panasonic and Leica share basically the same sensors across their full frame digital line. However, the sensor doesn‚Äôt matter much (unless particularly bad), and it‚Äôs mostly just the lens that matters. 

The culture and aesthetics of Leica are how they‚Äôve stayed a popular item for so long; it‚Äôs luxury. If you really love the aesthetics of Leica, I think there‚Äôs no better way to go than an M3 with a 50mm summicron.

lmiuwup,DeltaCharlieNiner,"Rough process I used (not a tutorial)

EDIT: this is specific to the M11, which seems to have much more durable paint than other black paint Leicas. I've also written about M10-P and M6 black chrome process in the past, very similar.

- Removed paint from black painted brass parts (dials, switch). This was done by carefully flaking off the paint with a sewing needle. Cleanup done with alcohol. Compared to what I did last time on my M10-P black chrome and M6 black chrome, the engraving paint is a lot more durable and doesn't simply wipe off with alcohol.

- Same as the above for black painted/powdercoated aluminium top shell, except the paint is much better adhered because the engravings were machined down to bare metal. Though the engravings are much shallower.

- Mixed lume powder with UV-setting resin, pretty much saturating it. Each time I just eyeball it, so I don't have an exact ratio.

- Applied lume mix to the dial engravings, wiping off excess with dry tissue, then cleaning up carefully with 60% alcohol. If I see smears from the engravings at this point, I've overdone the cleaning and need to be more careful.

- Use UV lamp to set the resin. Also a good time to check for any stray resin.

- For the top plate and switch engravings, because they are wide and shallow, I cannot wipe off excess easily. The textured paint doesn't help either. Instead I slowly add tiny drops of lume mix to the engraving, careful not to touch the edges, letting it flow out by itself. The end result is kinda domed, which I didn't want for the index marks, so I dabbed off excess with a tissue to flatten it out.

- Cured with UV lamp as well.

- One thing I would do differently is somehow darken the shiny aluminium in the top plate engravings. As the lume application is thinner, the bare metal underneath makes it look much lighter in daylight such that it doesn't match the lume-on-black for the dials.",7,1726012509.0,2024-09-10 23:55:09,,0,1fdjomi

lmmhlc6,UnusualEggplant5400,"On modern digital leicas you will be doing more harm at those apertures than benefit of dof compared to f5.6 or f8.

Go play with a dof calculator online to see the relation of aperture, focal length, and acceptable sharpened range.

For example 35mm @ f5.6 focused at 7m would provide acceptable sharpness from 3.47 m to infinity , at f8 it would be 2.85m to infinity , at f11 2.33m, at f 22 1.4m


Is the loss of iq due to direction worth the extra 2m of closer focus?


If you are shooting on film / older digital cameras diffraction wouldn‚Äôt be as noticeable, but in anything m10 era or newer you would totally be hurting the image quality at such small apetures",2,1726071259.0,2024-09-11 16:14:19,,0,1fe6aj0

lmnqsba,JohannGabriel,"Diffraction is a fundamental physical limitation in optics. Even modern lens can‚Äôt beat it. In simple words it leads to a small blurring of the image, which limits the usable resolution or detail of the image. The blurring can be reduced for larger aperture diameters and shorter focal lengths, i.e., less blurring is possible for smaller f-numbers or ‚Äûlarger apertures‚Äú. However, lenses with small f-numbers are difficult to correct in spherical aberration. Many lenses will not be limited by diffraction but spherical aberration at f/1.4 or f/2. For larger f-numbers the diffraction will get worse. At some point the blurring will be on the scale of the pixel pitch (size) on your sensor. For even larger f-number the blurring will be stretched over several pixels and you will notice a loss of detail. The f-number where you will be diffraction limited depends therefore rather on your sensor resolution and size. For a hight resolution with a smaller pixel pitch you will notice the diffraction already at smaller f-numbers. For extremely high resolutions, especially on small image sensor, you need lenses with small f-numbers and a very good correction for spherical aberration to benefit from the decreased diffraction. That is why at some point it doesn‚Äòt make sense to get more and more megapixels in your camera. 
A last resort to reduce diffraction is to go to shorter wavelengths. But most people don‚Äòt want to shoot in the UV. ;). But ASML is doing that with their photolithography machines. They are imaging chip structures on silicon wafers with a wavelength of 13.5 nm, while the visible range is from 400 to 800 nm.",3,1726085638.0,2024-09-11 20:13:58,,0,1fe6aj0

I have the Summicron V4 (same optical design as the current non-APO option) but I don't consider it as modern as it debuted in 1979. Similar story to the Contax G45 though.¬†

From what I've read most modern designs usually optimize for f/4. Diffraction is unavoidable when you close down and the ""peak performance"" aperture is a balance between diffraction and aberration correction.",2,1726050603.0,2024-09-11 10:30:03,,0,1fe6aj0

lmealx1,AnonymousBromosapien,">Isn‚Äôt everything designed for a specific purpose?

Well yea... everything is designed with intent... But that intent can be more or less specific. Are you suggesting that its not reductive to call it a *""$50 screw""*? 

If it is *""just a screw""* then go to a hardware store and find me a $0.10, $0.25, hell even a $5 screw that fulfills this purpose as well as the product in this post. The reality is, you cant just go into a hardwsre store and find a *""screw""* that does... So what does that make this? Well... in the manufacturing world... when you have to go and source something that you cant just go and pick up anywhere, we call that a *""specialty""* item/part.

Specialty goods are by definition *""have particularly unique characteristics and brand identifications for which a significant group of buyers is willing to make a special purchasing effort.""*

A screw is simply a fastener... and anybody who needs to fasten something can go buy any screw today at literally any hardware store. However, someone who wants to fasten something certainly isnt going to buy this specific screw... even if it was $0.10... they would almost certainly have no realistic use for it. Whereas opposite of that if someone wants to replace their red dot with some form of a screw they cant just go to any hardware store and find something that will work.

Again, the market for, and purpose of, this item is so specific that it is a specialty item.

Its fine to not like the price... or even the item. Personally, I wont buy one because like I said I dont mind the red dot. But there are people who will, and those people arent going to do so because they are trying to hang a picture frame on the wall lol... they are Leica owners with the specific intent of replacing their red dot with something designed and made to fit that space.

I really dont know why I spent so much time explaining that to you because I feel like you know the difference but are just being willfully ignorant because you dont like the price... but there it is anyways lol.",1,1725946015.0,2024-09-10 05:26:55,,0,1fd88eo

However, that also makes me relate to op's comment about the machine feeling soulless. I had been on the fence about going to a film only workflow and after shooting a ultra high energy small dark club show and seeing what was effectively a 100% hit rate on the eye I just felt like it wasn't what I was looking for in my journey trying to grow as a photographer. I acknowledge that's the douchiest thing I think I've ever said. All that is to say that when it's game time and it's a couple's wedding on the line, I think I would want modern tech that is ultra effective.

The select point then track option was better but still got lost when people did big turns.

I then adopted a more proactive style of waiting for the right action to come to my frame than trying to follow the movement. Single point or small area was much more effective for getting the right shots, and the SL2-S, hell the original SL, was not significantly worse than what I was able to accomplish with the Sony.

IMO, if you can afford to pick up a new M6 with a warranty do that.  Barring that, I'd get a more recent M7, or if the budget doesn't extend that far, I'd get a zeiss ikon zm.  It isn't as sexy, but it is much newer and as much as hardcore leica zealots hate to admit it, more reliable than a no newer than 43 years old M4-2.

lmmbof2,Andy_Shields,Shutter capping is essentially the first and second shutter either colliding at high speeds or potentially dragging although that is less common which will create a vertical bar across the horizontal plane either at the right or left side.

I have a 1953 Summitar, which my father bought new in Brooklyn on a business trip to the USA in 1953, along with a IIf body to have a spare to his IIIa and coated Summar.   
  
I have quite a large collection of Leicas, some 37 bodies and around 50 lenses, collected over 60 years and I am a third generation Leica user. The Summitar is better IMHO on B&W than it is on colour. My coated hex diaphragm model tends to give a blue-ish tint on colour negative, particularly on Fuji films. For classic colour rendition I prefer my 1955 50/2.8 Elmar-M or my 1959 50/1.5 Summarit-LTM. For B&W, I prefer the rendition of the earlier Summar to the Summitar.

lmw62hj,RWilsonL,"The best LTM lenses by some margin, are the 1999 year special edition Leica lenses, the last LTM lenses made by Leica. There are three of them, all chrome finish, brass bodied: A 50 Summilux III SE, a 50 Summicron V-SE and a 35 Summicron ASPH-SE. These for some odd reason were only marketed in Japan, were very expensive and snapped up by Japanese Leica collectors. 25 years later a number of these Japanese collectors have died and their Leica collections auctioned off. I arranged for a Japanese friend to bid for me at 2 auction sales and I have the two 50 mm lenses. These were apparently very carefully assembled and checked before leaving Solms. Over the years I have had a number of 50 Summicron IV and V lenses, which varied from being OK to being unusable but this special edition Summicron 50 is very good. Similarly the Summilux III has very little of the aperture shift that plagues many of these lenses and is one of my favourite lenses, given I am not a big fan of the 50 Summilux-M IV ASPH. These are the ultimate LTM lenses and although not cheap, you will never regret buying one of these. From time to time, they appear on eBay, usually from Japanese sellers.

-Good goes into so many places too.  I would think you would go about checking out the many 35mm lens options from Zeiss and Voigtlander.  A Leica Summicron is also a popular choice, since it is small it could even be best. 

The Leica M8 is cropped, so you may be happy with a 28mm.   The Elmarit 28 or the Summicron 28 are nice.  Voigtlander makes some great budget options as well.   The Zeiss Biogon 25mm F2.8 is a extremely loved lens as well.",2,1725941644.0,2024-09-10 04:14:04,,0,1fd8ab1

I‚Äôd skip the M10-P and opt for the higher resolution M10-R if you‚Äôre going the M route. Early on in your M orientation and possible lack of lenses, you‚Äôll appreciate the extra resolution if you need to crop heavily.

They are not the company that they used to be. Sometime within the past 6-10 months they stealthily changed their grading policy and many people are having issues with items in worse condition than advertised or items not functioning properly. The grading is also only cosmetic.

In the past 4 months I have personally had to send back 2 cameras listed as excellent plus; one for cosmetic issues that should have had it graded much lower, and one for a very obvious mechanical issue. If you do a search on /r/AnalogCommunity for 'KEH' you will see lots of other posts in this timeframe with similar problems, and many other commenters sharing their issues as well. All this is for film equipment, but I don't see why it doesn't apply to digital gear too. I'd actually be more apprehensive about digital gear because its more complicated.

Luckily their customer service is still good and my issues were quickly and easily resolved. But you would not get the customs fees back if you had an issue.

I think he's just in a position to be able to own both and with the Safari and the Matte Black both being limited edition lenses they've already increased in value. Mind you, he uses them. They don't just sit in a collection.

>I‚Äôm a huge fan of that retractable built-in hood

Oh yeah, me too. It's really interesting to me that they kept that specific design exclusive to the limited V2 asph 28's. Other than the color way the Drifter, Matte Black and Safari all are identical. 

Just a heads up for you. I've no clue why they did it but the MB has the slightest tint of green in the white paint. In the press release for the lens it is mentioned and fairly visible. It's less visible in person but depending on the light it's definitely there. It's a situation where it's so subtle I'm not sure why they bothered.",1,1726483060.0,2024-09-16 10:37:40,,0,1fc8ivf

lm95qkc,mactoniz,"It's more prudent to try out lower cost lens to see even if  focal length is right to the consumer than to invest thousands into something just 'tried out' at the Leica shop; only to found out it's not for them and attempt to resell to Leica at a loss... Those are Leica chumps, which Leica love since they line up Leica coffers.

Once your FL is found id advise looking into the Leica lineup as the combination can be worthwhile since they are optimally calibrated to work together. It means with reassurance that the only thing that can fail (IQwise) is the user; barring a mechanical failure from the equipment but that applies to everything...This due to optical tech working together.ie micro lens array, auto lens compensation correction, precise machining and even sensor color profile designed around Leica lenses. Whether one can discern the difference depends on the user and ultimately the amount of enlargement vs viewing distance.

Id suggest to watch Peter karbe talk about Leica lenses. From it I was able to have a greater appreciation on high amount of effort and precision goes in Leica lens.

lm82llk,Augustwest100,"Good advice from people who say that you should not worry about what other people think about your choices. If you feel doubt creeping in and it is getting to you, a good exercise to help you resolve doubt is to compare it to a Voigtlander, or a Ttartisan, or a Thypoch or whatever. Just bring your lens and camera to the store and try an alternate Leica lens or two. I find that this helps me to understand the differences between lenses and to realize that sometimes (most times) there is not a difference that matters to me.  I have traded Leica glass for Voigtlander in some cases, and have given up Voigtlander for Leica in others. Also there is nothing inherently wrong with matching a high res camera with a cheaper lens.

lm6ids9,Coldkennels,"The SBLOO really is the gold standard for a reason. It‚Äôs incredible. Very bright, good eye relief, decent size field of view without being a massive lump on top of the camera. 

On the other hand, the VC 28/35 mini finder is very underwhelming. It‚Äôs nice that it‚Äôs so small, but I find the 35mm framelines disappear too easily if the light is just slightly at the wrong angle. That might be because I wear glasses, though. I only use it for 28mm as a result. 

The Soviet turret finder isn‚Äôt accurate at 28mm or 35mm - the view is slightly too wide. I think ‚Äú35mm‚Äù is more like 30mm and ‚Äú28mm‚Äù is bordering on 25mm. I have no idea if the Zeiss version is the same. 

A VIOOH is surprisingly useable at 35mm. If you‚Äôre on a budget, that‚Äôd be my recommendation. I put the VC mini finder and the Soviet turret on the shelf for years and relied on the VIOOH until I lucked onto a cheap SBLOO. The fact it can also be used for a 73mm or 75mm lens if you‚Äôre missing the framelines for one is handy, too - that‚Äôs a relatively rare length to find a viewfinder for. 

On a related note, there‚Äôs also the VIDOM. A bit smaller than the VIOOH, and also includes a mark for the 105mm ‚ÄúMountain Elmar‚Äù. The catch? The view is mirrored. I find them basically unusable, but apparently Henri Cartier-Bresson was a big fan - the reversed view gave him a level of abstraction that supposedly helped with his framing. 

Special bonus note goes to the RASAL fold-down sports finder. It‚Äôs nuts. Looks absolutely massive, and while I own one, I‚Äôve still yet to actually use it. It is technically an option, though.",6,1725830641.0,2024-09-08 21:24:01,,0,1fc7b5w

lm6able,butangmucat,"So recently I started experimenting with using 35mm lenses on my M3.

At first I took YYe's advice of not buying goggled lenses (due to what he thinks as lower resale value and goggles breaking) and tried using the entire VF as a non-parallex-corrected 35mm frameline. However, I wear prescription glasses and this was not a fun experience.

I have tried a Voigtlander Turnit and a Tanaka Kogaku 35mm VF, both with some parallex correction that is manual. However neither is perfect
- Turnit has relatively good eye relief and reasonable framing accuracy, but it is bulky
- Tanaka 35mm VF (shown in picture) has terrible eye relief and framing accuracy is questionable

I have looked into those options
- Light Lens Lab Weisu replica (bought as curiosity item, but my LLL distributor warned me that it is more suitable for a 40mm framing and has no parallex correction, so it is mostly gathering dust)
- LLL or Leica SBLOO, depending on availability and price (can either get a used silver one off eBay or at my local Leica store, or get a brand-new black one from LLL to match my double-shoe setup that will be black themed)
- Sony FDA-V1 for their RX1, which somehow is even more expensive than the SBLOO options (on KEH at least) and I feel spending that price on a plasticky VF is not quite justifiable
- Leica X1 finder (18707), still plasticky but at a more reasonable price than the Sony option
- Zeiss 432/5 viewfinder, not sure how it feels but price is close to an SBLOO
- Zeiss Jena and KMZ turret viewfinders, OK for 50mm or longer but the 28 and 35mm options are still kinda painful based on what I remembered; also the bulkiest of all

I would like some help for
- What other options do you suggest? Preferrably modern bright-line ones or multi-function ones that cover both 28 and 35.
- For bright-line viewfinders, how do I interpret the framelines? Do I use the dotted (smaller) frame for close-up approximation?",2,1725828053.0,2024-09-08 20:40:53,,0,1fc7b5w

Honestly... dont even waste your time. $4200 is way to expensive. There are a dozen of them available on MPB right now with a 6 month warranty, all priced from $3000 to $3700 depending on condition from good to excellent. Zero reason to even waste your time looking at a local Q2 for $4200.

For rangefinder focusing, I am about to get consistent usable results on my 1.0 Noctilux wide open, but I had to re-adjust my rangefinder twice (and you would barely see a difference in the patch alignment), and I had to clean the rangefinder contact wheel at the mount.

lm6bqe0,Emma_Bovary_1856,"These are great lenses. The Elmarit 35 is an amazing lens with an insane sharpness to it while producing some of wildest bokeh in the out of focus areas. I really enjoy using that lens on film and digital as I use my R lenses on an R4s and adapted to an SL. 

That 135 is a portrait monster. Stop it down to f5.6 and get some of the sweetest portraits ever. 

I can also recommend a few others that I own and have used extensively:

1. The Elmarit 28 is probably my most used lens. For street photography, I only ever want to use that lens. Stopped down to f8, just about everything in front of you is in tack sharp focus and the color rendering is amazing. Used wide open and for portraits, you can get some nice bokeh and really sharp subjects. 

2. The Summicron 50, while not used as often by me as the 28, is likely the best lens of the bunch. What an amazing lens. I just came off a trip in the Caribbean using this lens for 90% of my photos and I have fallen in love with it all over again. Great for just about everything. 

3. The Elmarit 90 does everything the 135 does but is a little wider. I prefer it for portraits because it allows me to be closer to my subject, but either does the job exceptionally well. If I travel with three lenses it‚Äôs usually 28/50/90. Occasionally I‚Äôll travel with 35/90. Not a bad combo at all. 

4. If you are into zooms there are a few options in the R series. The 35-70 f4.5 is the one most will tell you to get. I‚Äôve never used it because I like the 28mm focal length so much I wouldn‚Äôt get much use out of it. Instead I got the Vario Elmar 28-70 f3.5-4.5. I firmly believe that those who say this lens is not worth your time are either snobs who don‚Äôt like that this Leica designed lens was built in Japan by Sigma or have no experience with the lens and just repeat what the snobs have said. It‚Äôs an awesome lens that has never let me down for either professional or personal use.

There are not enough people championing these R lenses. M lenses are legendary for a reason, but most of these R lenses were designed by the same folks who designed their M counterparts and were seen as superior due to their closer focusing distances.

I am now looking for a Leicaflex SL or SL2 to use in conjunction with my R4s. The R4s has been an amazing travel companion. It's small and light with a deadly accurate light meter. I quite literally never miss exposure with that body. But I would love to take a second body with me when I travel so I could have one loaded with low ISO film for daytime and one loaded with high ISO film for nighttime. This is one of the reasons why I still travel with with a digital camera. Especially for family vacations, where I will not be able to reproduce the events later, I want to ensure I capture them and my SL 601 is the perfect way to do that while still using the R glass. But at the very least I could keep shooting film past dusk with another body.

I've travelled with low and high ISO film with one body before and I found I was just firing off shots and wasting exposures to make sure I was able to chuck the fast film in there by sunset. I hated the feeling. So Leicaflex it is.

By the way, after looking at your serial numbers again, these are 60's lenses like my own. These are probably one cam, possibly two cam lenses. I've never done it myself but everyone recommends NOT using these lenses on an R8/9. Apparently using these one and two cam lenses can damage the contacts on the R8/9 and will leave you unable of ever using the ROM lenses.

lm15r7p,armevans,"Hello! I went through the same thing recently. Here are the key takeaways from my search (I really should save these‚Äîthis is like the fourth time in a couple weeks that I‚Äôve posted the same info):

Coatings: the V4 and V5 are the same optical formula, but there are differences in the lens coatings between early and late V4s and between V4s and V5s. Later lenses have better coatings, as you might expect, so they‚Äôre more resistant to flare.

Construction: early V4s have plastic internal parts that can break, and no spare parts are available. For this reason, YYe and others tend to advise against these lenses if serviceability and long-term reliability are considerations for you. Later V4s (made in Germany) have metal internal parts that are less likely to break, but still no replacement parts available. The V5 is still being manufactured and thus parts availability is excellent. It is also an easier to service design.

Hoods: V4s take conventional hoods. V5s have an integrated hood. Some people prefer one or the other, but you‚Äôll never be caught without a hood if you have a V5.

Focus tab: V4s have one of two varieties of focus tab. Some people have preferences for concave or convex; some folks don‚Äôt love the shape or position of the tab. V5s don‚Äôt have a tab, but DAG can add a permanent tab to the V5 for $90.

Six-bit coding: coding can be added to any of these lenses, but only later V5s are factory-coded. That‚Äôs nice if you‚Äôre shooting a digital M but not essential. No need to worry about this if you only shoot film.

Based on all that info, I went for a later V5 with factory six-bit coding and paid DAG to add a focus tab. It is a spectacular lens, and I can‚Äôt recommend it enough. Personally, I love the built-in hood, and the aftermarket tab works great for me. The V5 is on my M10 90% of the time, and I never find myself wishing I‚Äôd brought a different 50.",5,1725751972.0,2024-09-07 23:32:52,,0,1fbjhal

lm14uqe,Raptor470,"Got both for my M6, M11 & M10M.

The v4 is the Tiger Claw version and I got that lens when I was in Wetzlar and tested the modern Crons out. After a while I told the Leica Store Wetzlar staff member I prefer the Cron 50 with a focus tab and he told me it happens that a v4 is in Service for a complete overhaul and will be put for sell in the Leica Classic Store. So i bought that lens immediately the lens was sent to me weeks after.

Even after the complete overhaul the focus ring is not smooth . You feel resistance and if you got the intended focus you try to stop but you miss the spot either before or after.

So I ordered after 2 years a v5. Boy this lens runs extremely smooth and it is much easier handling the focus ring. Smooth operation and I am able to stop it perfectly when I nail the focus via rangefinder.

Only downside is the missing focus tab - but it sin't that dramatic as I have a mix of Leica, Voigtlander, Light Lens Lab & Funleader lenses with and without focus tabs.

I don't care about the built-in lens hood on the v5 - except for tele lenses. In general I don't use any lens hoods. 

If you are into character lenses I can highly recommend the Light Lens Lab ELCAN 50mm.

lm5pbhv,fineYogurtAndBerries,"Can be lots of different effects, but I'd guess one of them is the ISO on both cameras. Judging from dxomark:

[https://www.dxomark.com/Cameras/Leica/Q-Typ-116---Measurements](https://www.dxomark.com/Cameras/Leica/Q-Typ-116---Measurements)

[https://www.dxomark.com/Cameras/Leica/M10---Measurements](https://www.dxomark.com/Cameras/Leica/M10---Measurements)

the M10 comes out about a stop darker (ISO 200 was measured as 105). Also, the color response of the sensors is completely different.

Other than that, The difference really seems drastic. Since you shot both images at the same settings, I can only pinpoint the ISO here. Does the RAW file have an exposure compensation written in its profile? Some do, you'd have to manually set both to the same EV in the RAW editor to truely match both files. (The editor may preset it to the embedded value for you).

Metering-wise, keep in mind that the M10 only has center-weighted metering when not in live view mode. What does the exposure triangle say if you let the camera meter in the same mode?

  
Edit: Moving away from exposure settings, make sure to experiment a little with pushing up the shadows, in RAW of course. Especially at lower ISO (up to 800, 1600) I've had zero trouble pushing them 3 stops (or even more).

I saw a video on the M11 where the YouTuber commented how the Q? he was shooting was also brighter than his M11 at the same settings. I'm gonna assume the Q's just work a little differently.

lmicbc4,fineYogurtAndBerries,"It's totally valid to compare tools. It was also something I was not aware of, either. I can tell you, accomodating yourself to the M10's quirks might take a while but once you figure it out, the M10 will deliver.

Quick tips from my side (all for center-weighted metering, not liveview):

* like said, the M10 files have so much data in the shadows, you should always underexpose when shooting RAW. My usual go to is to meter against the bright sections of the frame, and have an EV of -.3 to -.7 dialed in. I correct the rest in post.
* for night shots, I even tend to underexpose by -1.7 when streetlights are in the frame. I frame with the streetlight in the center first, dial the exposure to match -1.3 or -1.7 and reframe. Now the tricky part is the shutter speed. When you are used to other cameras, you tend to preselect a higher ISO first, and now get higher shutter speeds. That is tricky. WIth ISO invariant sensors, you can basically pick a shutter speed and see what the sensor makes out of it. It will be all you get anyway.
* Don't use ISO 100 on the M10, it's a pull value and actually has less usable dynamic range than the 200 setting. From DXOmark, the ISO 200 setting is pretty much a 100 equivalent anyway. I tend to use only 3 ISO values, 200 at daylight and 800/1600 at night. You have to trust your gut though for this to work.

My guidance for night shots is:

* find your shutter speed at let's say 1/125th to match -1.3EV or so and figure out suitable ISOs. Push the shadows in post. That way, you let enough light in to get cleaner shadows, because otherwise you might expose for the streetlight at 3200 or 6400 ISO, and get shutter speeds of 1/500th of a second.

And lastly: give it time, and try to use it fully manual. Figure out what the exposure display in the rangefinder does when you change the framing. You will notice that you get a gut feeling for it.",1,1726005801.0,2024-09-10 22:03:21,,0,1fbaoc4

I found the leather to be extremely stiff. People say once you break it in it's nice and soft. I'd rather spend a little more money on a nicer leather and have it soft from the get go.

There is a strong argument to be made that the M is not the ideal tool for super wide or tele lenses in general and that the screen or EVF attachment could be considered workarounds for shooting those lenses. 

And we can have differing opinions and that‚Äôs fine, but if we‚Äôre talking about capabilities and being objective then the lack of autofocus on M cameras should be disqualifying, and it‚Äôs not. A lot of people would argue it‚Äôs a feature. 

I‚Äôm not quite understanding why the subtraction of a screen can‚Äôt be a feature as well.

The other thing about it is that chimping stifles creativity.  And it‚Äôs especially true with a rangefinder. With the optical viewfinder, you get to imagine how the final photo will look and then choose your settings and composition based upon that. An image that has been chimped is just an incomplete vision, and it can be discouraging and a bit defeating to analyze something like that while out shooting.

The omission of the screen is not an alternative, it is a straight lack of capability. This is important because you can simply disable the LCD screen and have the exact same camera in terms of functionality. 

The problem with your argument is that Leica has the balls to charge the SAME or MORE for an objectively shittier and less capable camera and they cover it with some BS marketing. People fall for it and enables this kind of behaviour.

llvcg33,FritzChemiker,"If you‚Äôre experiencing shutter issues with your Leica R4, you‚Äôre probably aware that these types of problems can be tricky to diagnose and even trickier to fix. Leica cameras, particularly older models like the R4, are celebrated for their craftsmanship and precision, but that also means that when things go wrong, it can feel like you‚Äôre navigating a labyrinth to figure out the issue.

First things first: when dealing with shutter issues, the immediate reaction is to troubleshoot. Sometimes, it‚Äôs as simple as a sticky mechanism due to dirt or dust. A good cleaning, whether it‚Äôs using a blower to remove dust or gently cleaning the camera body with a microfiber cloth, can go a long way. Many times, grime buildup around the shutter release or mirror box can cause malfunctions. You could try this method before diving into more complex solutions.

If cleaning doesn‚Äôt do the trick, you might turn your attention to the battery. The Leica R4, while a mechanical marvel, relies on its battery for some functions, including the shutter. A dying or dead battery could easily be the culprit behind your camera‚Äôs failure to fire properly. Before panicking, replace the battery with a fresh one and see if that makes a difference. Be sure to clean the battery contacts in the compartment as well, as corrosion or dirt could be interfering with the flow of power.

Still nothing? OK. Next, we enter the realm of technical fixes. Shutter problems can sometimes stem from issues with the camera‚Äôs electronics or internal mechanisms. If the shutter isn‚Äôt opening or closing smoothly, there could be a deeper issue with the springs or gears. Leica cameras are known for their complex engineering, and the R4 is no exception. At this point, you might consider disassembling the camera to inspect the mechanism‚Ä¶ but be warned: Leica cameras are intricate machines, and one wrong move can do more harm than good.

So, where do we go from here? At this stage, it‚Äôs typically best to leave things in the hands of a professional. Leica-trained technicians or reputable vintage camera repair shops can often diagnose and fix issues that go beyond the scope of DIY maintenance. Sure, it‚Äôs going to cost you‚Äîand you may need to part with your camera for a few weeks or even longer‚Äîbut if you love your Leica R4, it might be worth it for the peace of mind.

Now, let‚Äôs talk about that cost. A typical repair for a vintage camera like the R4, especially for something like a shutter issue, could run you several hundred dollars. You might also have to factor in shipping costs if you don‚Äôt have a local Leica specialist. And let‚Äôs not forget the possibility of needing replacement parts. While Leica cameras are built to last, spare parts for older models are becoming harder to come by. If your repair requires something like a specific gear, spring, or circuit, you could be looking at a long wait time.

After all of this, there‚Äôs no guarantee that the repair will fix the problem permanently. Vintage cameras, especially ones with electronic components like the Leica R4, are known for developing new issues over time. After one repair, you could find yourself chasing down more problems in the future, which means more money, more time, and more frustration.

Which brings me to my final point, and perhaps the simplest solution of all. Instead of going through all of these troubleshooting steps, worrying about repairs, and sinking time and money into a potentially unpredictable camera, you could just‚Ä¶ buy another Leica R4.

Think about it: buying a new-to-you Leica R4 isn‚Äôt as expensive as you might think, especially when compared to the costs of repairs and the uncertainty that comes with fixing older electronics. It‚Äôs fast, easy, and you‚Äôll be shooting again in no time. Plus, you can always keep your original R4 for spare parts, or maybe even sell it to someone willing to tinker with it.

Even if you‚Äôre just curious about the system, you could quite easily get your money back if you bought and resold (heck, I would happily buy it from you for this asking price).

I moved from the X-T5 to the M10 earlier this year and haven‚Äôt looked back. I didn‚Äôt like the Fujifilm much (I liked it less than my previous X-T2, honestly), and I loved shooting with my film M4. So the Leica system was already familiar, I had some lenses, and I knew my way around the rangefinder workflow.

If any of these apply to you, I‚Äôd definitely think hard before upgrading to an M camera. 

They are incredible tools, but they have their quirks. They‚Äôre manual focus cameras, generally best when shooting 135 mm and under, and our best catered to shooting RAW (though that‚Äôs not the case always). For $2100 that‚Äôs an excellent price if it‚Äôs legit, but it is a very different camera from an XT-5 so do your research before committing.",2,1725681614.0,2024-09-07 04:00:14,,0,1fann2v

It‚Äôs worth it if you are comfortable with and prefer rangefinder focusing/shooting. If you aren‚Äôt familiar with it it‚Äôs a gamble- and if you don‚Äôt like it, it‚Äôs just a bad decision.

Technically speaking when it comes to abilities and IQ? The XT5 is a far more flexible tool with the EVF, mirrorless adaptability of almost any lens ever made, the great video abilities, I believe the XT5 has pixel shift (?) in case that‚Äôs useful in your work. In some ways, it likely delivers better IQ‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs nitpicking to some degree, assuming we‚Äôre comparing best-case scenarios (good light, low ISO, etc).

llwx9li,armevans,"The M10 by a huge margin. Manual focusing on an EVF, even with focus peaking, magnifying, and all the other aids, is a pain. It‚Äôs especially unpleasant with focus-by-wire lenses without hard stops (which includes most Fuji lenses). I much, much prefer an optical viewfinder, and the big, bright viewfinder on the M10 is among the very best I‚Äôve encountered.

I didn‚Äôt find that 40mp files offered notable benefits over 24mp files for most of the photography I do (though it was cool for document scanning and other tasks like that). Dealing with the larger files ended up a hassle most of the time, so the 24mp of the M10 is fine for me, and the larger sensor makes a much bigger difference in my view, as does being able to use my Leica lenses at their correct field of view.

People really celebrate Fuji color science, but I‚Äôve been really impressed with the colors from the M10 sensor and frankly struggled with the colors from the X-T5 both in JPEGs and raw files. Fuji raw files still don‚Äôt work great in Lightroom, and I‚Äôm too invested in the Adobe ecosystem to switch to Capture One or another editing software.

Even the battery life of the M10 (which people often cite as a negative quality of the camera) seems to outstrip the X-T5, which is understandable given that the Fuji battery is powering stabilization, OVF, etc.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Äîthe Fuji is a lovely and capable camera, but I don‚Äôt miss it at all. The Leica works better for me in pretty much every area. That probably wouldn‚Äôt be the case for many photographers, but the switch absolutely paid off for me.",3,1725686217.0,2024-09-07 05:16:57,,0,1fann2v

llsi7hu,iskosalminen,"I would still like to see some improvements on my workflow, as it currently has too much manual labor, but it works for me. Note that I travel *a lot* so I rely heavily on finding photos based on their geolocations.

1. Import RAW files with Leica FOTOS app on iPhone so I get geolocations added to them
2. Open LR on iPhone and import and organize RAW files into LR albums
3. Once LR has synced all files to Adobe Cloud, delete all RAW files from Apple Photos
4. Import JPEGs with Leica FOTOS app so I get geolocations added to the JPEGs
5. Edit RAW files in LR on either iPad or desktop

I keep the Leica JPEGs on Apple Photos and RAW files in Lightroom.

The above process takes some time, requires some manual labor, and consumes a lot of data to transfer all the files. If I wouldn't need the Adobe Cloud to sync all the RAW files on the go, I'd love to not rely on cloud and instead use a local device or some cheaper cloud service. I'm running out of the 1Tb Adobe Cloud storage later this year and it would be cheaper to buy a dedicated NAS storage than to pay for the cloud storage... if anyone has any tips or recommendations

Edit: I forgot to mention that I never erase or format the SD cards but instead use them as backups. I consider SD cards as film negatives/slides.

llpuf9a,HoratioFitzmark,"I'm going to tell you what you don't want to hear, and what I suspect will not be a popular answer.

The camera you need for capturing everyday family moments is an iphone.

You always have it with you, it is always on, if you set it up correctly you are going from in your pocket to snapping away in about two seconds, and the up to date ones provide phenomenal image quality with all of the basic editing tools you need right there in the phone.  It shoots good video as well as stills, to boot.  It shoots RAW files with the correct setup.  With mine at least, you have up to 5x zoom before it starts cropping, meaning you can print good sized prints from the output all day long and in a wide variety of shooting situations.

Using your iphone as your go to practical everyday moment camera system has the benefit of freeing you up to buy whatever you want to use as your 'photography as a hobby' camera.  Stick with an M, you clearly enjoy it.  Upgrade to an M11 if you are able.  Just don't worry about chasing a kid around with it.",22,1725582022.0,2024-09-06 00:20:22,,0,1f9ybl3
llp6sz6,RacletteFoot,"Like you, I went through all the motions, including an extensive set of high-end everything. Once the kid arrived, lugging all this stuff around turned out to be very, very impractical.

It's amazing. It's super fast. It has snap focus - meaning you can simply depress the shutter and it will need zero time to focus. Image quality is outstanding - and the camera is tiny and lightweight.

I‚Äôve been through this exact thing where I‚Äôve thought I‚Äôd be better off with a Q or a GRIII, but when you get those scans back from the lab the feeling goes away and the relationship with the M6 is renewed. 

My partner and I made an album for our sons first year and despite having hundreds of iPhone photos (which are great in their own right), it was the 35mm and 120 film photos that were usually the most captivating and memorable. Film just has that way about it, especially these days.

I love Leica analog cameras and I think digital Leicas are great lifestyle cameras, but I don't personally believe Leica makes a digital camera up to the task that you need a camera for. Its not the tool for the job.

I have two very young children. Once they start moving, especially running around, the shooting environments you will find yourself in are very similar to sports. There are reasons sports photographers don't use Leicas. You will have the most success and least amount of headaches with a system that gives you fast AF and zoom lenses are better. I've long been a prime guy but the kids had me start using zooms.

The Q3, Ricoh, Fuji x100 are awesome cameras, I like them all, but I couldn't imagine having one as my main camera to use with children. I really feel Sony is the best option here. The A7CR is a marvel of a camera. FF sensor, IBIS, fast AF, the Sony lens lineup and with how small it is, its awesome. If you think you will shoot video as well then its no question for me.

Maybe that and the Q3 as your dream digital Leica/fun lifestyle is the best option if you can swing it.",4,1725578677.0,2024-09-05 23:24:37,,0,1f9ybl3
llq7x5d,mrjosh72,"Wow, this is one of those threads where I just disagree with almost everyone's advice.

The M system definitely works with kids. Especially little ones‚Äîthey don't move a lot. But also toddlers and up. I have shot thousands and thousands of excellent photographs of my kids with my Ms, film and digital. They are beautiful pictures that I made by hand, controlling the camera myself, and they have the classic, immersive, handheld look of manual-focus rangefinder photography. Yes, you need practice‚Äîbut you'll get that, because you'll obsessively photograph your children. Yes, there are shots you'll miss, but that's no biggie. You may struggle to get perfect focus at f/1.4 while your toddler toddles directly towards you, but what percentage of your family photos will involve that particular scenario? And you'll get good. A couple of weeks ago I caught my son blowing out his birthday candles at f/1.2.

Meanwhile, you'll get the advantages of the M system. Beautiful optics, small bodies and lenses (and a huge library of them to choose from), film and digital interoperability, a bright clear OVF (no looking at life through a screen), super-fast range focusing, precise wide-open focusing, vintage rendering if you buy old-school lenses, and the romance of an analog or analog-feeling digital camera. And the fun of developing skills instead of just mashing buttons and letting computers do the work for you.

I've used all the other cameras for family photos. I could list the downsides of all of them: no viewfinder, a fixed focal length, ultra-clean super-detailed hyper-real rendering (not so great for kids and tired parents and aging grandparents), or over-digital experiences that make photographing your kids all about navigating menus. The bottom line is that looking at your family through an EVF with little boxes for face and eye detect is no fun. All cameras have downsides; the key thing is to give yourself time to learn to work within and around constraints. So I say, if you want to get an M, get an M, and enjoy it! And whatever you do, don't document your family life on your phone.

The one exception, for me, has been telephoto photography. Like kids' soccer games and theatre performances. For that stuff, I've recently bought an SL2-S. You won't have to worry about any of that for many years.

Edit to add: on a practical level, if you have a 35 Lux‚Äîis it the FLE?‚Äîthen a very good plan, to my mind, would be to buy an M10 or M10R, and then an affordable Voigtlander 50 until you have the budget for a 50 Lux ASPH or 50 Cron v5.

P.S. If you're curious, message me and I'll happily share you on an album of some family photos taken with M cameras.

P.P.S. My son has a bike and now zooms around at 15 miles an hour. So, it's like running, but worse, because I'm often on a bike, too. And it's very possible to use rangefinders in this scenario. Set the focus, judge the distance, pedal until your subject is in the right zone. It involves creativity and problem solving. I prefer this system to just using continuous AF and face detect. And the out of focus shots have a special beauty to them, too; the happy accidents of the M system are one of its secret benefits.",7,1725586864.0,2024-09-06 01:41:04,,0,1f9ybl3

llp9wuz,Mcjoshin,"I dream of owning an M11-P someday, but for now I just have a poor man‚Äôs Leica, an X100VI. IMO, it‚Äôs THE perfect everyday camera. 90% of the time, I treat it like film in full manual mode, manual focus with OVF (zone focus), and leave the screen off. I like how it slows me down, similar to film. I like how it makes me focus more on composition. It‚Äôs made me a better photographer and rekindled my love for photography. I love the film simulations and never having to edit. Want a disposable 90‚Äôs film cam look? Done. Portra 400? Easy. HP5 B&W? Sure. I can just focus on shooting and sharing photos without ever opening Lightroom which is wonderful, because I don‚Äôt have time to edit photos anyways lol. 

The kicker though is you still get all the modern comforts when needed. If I‚Äôm capturing photos of my fast moving nieces/nephews running around, I just switch to continuous autofocus and aperture priority, turn on the EVF, and switch to burst mode‚Ä¶ its the best of both worlds. Not to mention the built in ND, flash, and leaf shutter are incredible. The video is fantastic as long as you‚Äôre not moving a ton (ibis is great for locked off and slow panning shots, not so great for walking). Don‚Äôt want to color grade and just want ready to share short video clips? Throw on that film sim you love and clips are ready to share in seconds. Want 10 Bit 4:2:2 6k video to grade in post, cool, you get that too. All of this fits in a jacket pocket btw and is easy to have with you everywhere.

I can‚Äôt speak to photographing kids with a Leica, but I can tell you I absolutely love the X100VI as an everyday camera and it‚Äôs sure nice to have the full manual film like experience (M11) AND the auto experience (Q3) all in one little package. Then you can also get the wide/tele converters and you have a 28/35/50mm video setup and 28/35/40/50/60/70/100mm for photos with crop mode and the whole setup fits into a tiny bag for travel.",2,1725574638.0,2024-09-05 22:17:18,,0,1f9ybl3

I think my biggest issue was feeling like I miss shots at times when it‚Äôs just me with her and I am using one hand to carry something or push the stroller. I have always wanted an AF camera for those moments but nothing has really satisfied me. I‚Äôve tried the Ricohs and really wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the user experience or the autofocus. I really love the output from the Q system and it‚Äôs a joy to use but it‚Äôs a bit large and I am not really a fan of 28mm. 

I picked up the Nikon zf when it released and it‚Äôs the first camera that I really fell in love with that has AF. The 3d tracking is amazing. Unfortunately my wife has since taken the zf from me as she has picked up photography herself so I went back to the drawing board for that AF option.  

I recently picked up the x100vi (impulse buy because I found it for retail) and honestly I think I‚Äôm going to sell it and maybe just get a second ZF. I really love the 24mp sensor they put in it and adapting lenses is a lovely experience on the ZF. 

I‚Äôve gotten pretty good at manual focus and judging distances with the M. I even focus one handed with the M pretty often using my pinky but most of the time I just anticipate the distance and pre-focus. The nice thing about the manual focus process and M lenses in general is that you find out the slightly out of focus images can sometimes be ones you end up cherishing the most.

I do this and capture pretty much every moment I want to. 28mm f/16 + flash just always works for me.

Taking pictures of my kid is probably the worst bit of shooting a rangefinder. They move so damn fast that sometimes you're going to just miss those shots, unless the setup is perfect for zone focus etc etc. Honestly it's the one time I do sometimes find I want an AF camera again, but then I can't bring myself to spend the large amount of money on doing so. Thankfully babies don't move fast, so you do get a good period before the running around starts.

Keep your M6 for photography when you want to go out and shoot. Use the A7R II for the family stuff, just don't load yourself down with twenty lenses to cover all focal lengths that just get bulky and annoying. One or two primes, done.

Now, if you **really** want a digital Leica, time with the A7R II + fast prime will tell you whether it is going to be the right choice (ie: AF or not). If you're going AF the only choice is a Q2/Q3 (assuming SL series is out), and you're going to have to be fine with the fixed lens.

llnzpzf,Anakronox,"It‚Äôs your metering mode that influences the balance of highlights/shadows once your exposure triangle (shutter speed, aperture, iso) have been calculated by the auto or semi-auto mode.  You‚Äôll need to meter the scene differently if you don‚Äôt want those blown. 

But the real question is: why do you care if a lightbulb is blown out?  Is it the true subject of your shot?  If it isn‚Äôt, I wouldn‚Äôt personally worry over it.  Specular highlights and point light sources are gonna be blown most of the time anyway.

llnrbze,QuantumTarsus,"There are two likely issues:

1. Monochrome sensors blow out the highlights much easier than color sensors. It is recommended to set the exposure compensation to -0.7-1.0 and bring the shadows up in post to ameliorate this tendency. 
2. Leica light meters, specifically the matrix or multifield metering, are not as advanced as the meters in Sony, Nikon, or Canon, etc. I did find that the highlight-weighted metering on the Q2M I had worked better than standard matrix metering. That said, even my Sony will blow out the highlights if the light source is direct/bright enough.",3,1725557280.0,2024-09-05 17:28:00,,0,1f9r6d1
llou0l9,TheSwordDusk,"Lightbulbs are so bright that they hurt your eyes to look at. There is something called ""dynamic range"" which is how much your eyes or your camera can see from pure blackness to blown out white. Our eyes have more dynamic range than a camera, meaning we can see nearly black black details, and nearly white details better than a camera, and we can see scenes with both nearly black and nearly white better than a camera.

A camera can only show you a certain range of light. In order to show you some nearly black shadow details, it has to give up the closest to white. This is okay, lightbulbs ""blowing out"" looks completely normal and is okay. It's also okay to make the sun pure white.

Don't worry about blowing out light bulbs themselves. Worry about blowing out skin tone or or a sky (if you care, I don't always) or whatever the important thing is in your picture. The light bulbs or daytime sun aren't usually the important parts of your picture to capture details

Similarly, it's okay to make stuff black sometimes",3,1725569437.0,2024-09-05 20:50:37,,0,1f9r6d1
llo97k3,Garbanzififcation,"I guess it depends on what it was doing with the rest of the scene as to whether the auto exposure was 'correct' or not.

Highlight Weighting works nicely because of the ability of the monochrome sensor to capture detail you can't see with your eyes.

Blown highlights (unlike colour sensors, which can sometimes find detail in another channel) are gone forever. But fiddle in Lightroom on something underexposed and you can find hidden details.

Experiment with exposure compensation, even fairly extreme, and see what happens. Dark is not a bad thing on a Q2M.",2,1725562924.0,2024-09-05 19:02:04,,0,1f9r6d1

I will say 35mm is generally your general purpose lens. Not committed to where you may need more room to back up with a 50mm but still get a decent amount of bokeh and separation when shot wide open & not too wide like a 24 or 28mm makes people feel. To me 35mm a focal length that is perfect if you have commitment issues when you only want to bring one lens out.

How are your compositions looking to you that makes you feel excited? What are you shooting generally with the lens?

I do a lot of portrait work and I can treat 35mm pretty similar to how I treat compositions shot on 50mm. Pure portraiture. 28mm imo gives me more environmental portraits where the space is just as important as the people in the photograph.",4,1725489492.0,2024-09-04 22:38:12,,0,1f96d6x

llkuh88,HoratioFitzmark,"Come on back down to earth a bit and consider some basic facts and possibilities.

First, are you trying to carry just one camera and lens?  Remember that the ""true normal"" focal length is 42-43mm, which makes 35mm only as wide as 50mm is telephoto.  If you are only planning on carrying one camera and lens, the 35mm is the best choice for you, as you are already comfortable with it, and all you have to do to bring more of the outside environment into frame is back up a few feet.

Second, if you are going to carry multiple lenses and want to carry the 28 as a wide, do you already have a normal/telephoto like a 50 or a 75 that you plan on carrying too, or is this really an exercise in buying two lenses?  Remember that you can only get so close sometimes, and the wider your lens the less flattering it is for portraiture.

Third, don't forget that a new lens isn't going to make you a better photographer.  Gear doesn't solve inadequacies, it just creates new ones.  If you see the world in 35mm like you say you do, all you need to do is get further away rather than closer to get a 28mm-like experience.  It's a skill issue, not a gear issue.  Remember, the goal is the image, not how the image was made.  No one is going to care how close you got to the subject when you took the picture as long as you got the shot.  You aren't a Navajo counting coup on an enemy in an effort to demonstrate bravery, you are just a person trying to take the best photo.",2,1725508987.0,2024-09-05 04:03:07,,0,1f96d6x

lljho7k,moghul1,"I love the 35mm, it has served me in portraits, landscapes and street shooting. I would say I've come to see the world in 35mm and know what the picture will look like before taking it. I think as I've grown confident with shooting I find myself getting closer to subjects and allowing myself to be in the mix a little more.

I look back on my shots and realise that the pictures have contextual intimacy (a phrase I made up to explain the lens). The 28mm is a tough road to walk because 35mm, as you mentioned, is all purpose. It doesn't impose its focal length on the image where as 28mm is always imposing that immersive feeling, which gives more context.

My dilemma really comes from trying to discern if that extra 7mm is necessary. I've used the iPhone to take 28mm/35mm shots and I find the 35mm excludes the right amount of extra image to give a stronger composition/focal point. But with the 28mm, when travelling, that environment becomes apart of the story.

lljf1a4,GammaDeltaTheta,"I've used a few, mostly a IIIc, but also a IIIa and a IIIg. The IIIb I picked up most recently might be my favourite of the lot - it's slightly smaller than the later models but has the adjacent VF and RF eyepieces I prefer. Technically the IIIg is the best user, but the largest of all.

III - Original model, shutter speeds top out at 1/500. Only model that's easy to find in black.

IIIa - First model with 1/1000.

IIIb - First model with RF and VF eyepieces adjacent (a bit more convenient), and eypiece adjustment lever moved to rewind knob. Less common than most other models.

IIIc - First model with die-cast construction, slightly bigger and more robust (though earlier models have proved very tough). Two variants, wartime (knob on eyepiece adjuster, step under rewind release) and post-war (without these features).

IIId - Extremely rare and collectable, basically a wartime IIIc with a self-timer.

IIIf - First model with flash sync, and film reminder in wind-on knob. Variants with and without self-timer. Early bodies are 'black dial', later 'red dial' with some differences in shutter speeds.

IIIg - Unique model. Larger than the others (and rather less pocketable) to accommodate more sophisticated viewfinder, with parallax-corrected brightline framelines for 50mm and 90mm lenses. All previous models have only 50mm viewfinders without framelines, so you'll need accessory finders for any other focal length. Rangefinder is still separate to viewfinder. Film reminder is dial on back, like M3. May be more expensive to service due to greater complexity.

There were small, less visible improvements over time, like improved shutter designs. You may find cameras where features have been added at the factory later, like a IIIa with IIIf-style flash sync. It's also common to find cameras with third party flash sync sockets added (be wary of these - some are better done than others). 

Unless you want some specific feature, condition and service history is more important than anything else. Look out for dim second rangefinder images, shutter curtain pinholes, rough dry mechanisms, disintegrating vulcanite covering, and erratic shutters. Factor in the cost of a service, which can cost nearly as much as the camera from a real expert.

These are great little cameras to use, and are fast to shoot with once you get the knack. You can easily stuff one in a jacket pocket if you have a collapsible 50mm lens (Elmars and Summitars are a good bet, and can be found coated). Vintage 90mm and 135mm Leitz lenses are pretty cheap and easy to find, wideangles like the 35mm Summaron rather more expensive. Old Soviet lenses are cheap, but beware of sometimes questionable QC and focusing issues. Vintage screwmount lenses from Japan (e.g. Canon) may be a better bet. There are also some very nice modern lenses in the Leica screwmount fitting; Voigtl√§nder is one name to look out for (but make sure they are screwmount rather than M mount). 

Follow the loading instructions carefully, and make sure you trim the film leader to the profile shown in the manual (see p29):

[https://www.cameramanuals.org/leica\_pdf/leica\_if\_iif\_iiif.pdf](https://www.cameramanuals.org/leica_pdf/leica_if_iif_iiif.pdf)

You can buy (overpriced) vintage trimming templates, or cheap plastic modern ones to use with a sharp knife, or just use a small pair of scissors, taking care to cut between rather than across sprocket holes and rounding off the corner.

llmorrt,Coldkennels,"I currently own a Leica IIIa, Ic, two IIIfs, and a IIIg. I've also previously owned a If. Most of the comments here have covered what the core differences are.

For a long time, I thought the only thing they lacked was a lever wind, so I picked up a Leotax T2L ""Elite"" (which is basically the same as a IIIc, only with a wind lever). I realised that the wind lever just snagged on things all the time, and I preferred the knob wind of the Leicas.

I thought they lacked a built-in 35mm finder and maybe there's something to this whole combined ""frameline finder"" thing, so I picked up a Canon 7, only to realise I didn't enjoy using a combined RF/VF, as it's less accurate and harder to focus... and I didn't even enjoy 35mm lenses much. Nor did I enjoy having a back that opened - it just made everything feel less solid and definite in my hand.

No matter what happened, I keep coming back to the IIIf. It's the perfect camera for me and the peak of the Barnack design. The IIIa is more traditional, but the viewfinders are further apart, making it slower to use. The Ic is smaller and perfect for wide angles (28mm and wider) or zone focusing 50mm lenses, but isn't really suitable for anything longer. The IIIg's finder is much nicer, but the added bulk breaks compatibility with a lot of accessories.

See, what the original Leica design is _really_ good at is modularity. It was designed not only to be small and portable, but to be adaptable to literally any situation. If you look at the various Leica pamphlets from the 1930s, you'll see they made gadgets for everything. The IIIf really is the peak of that design ethos for me. There's basically nothing it can't do.

2. The annoying way: prepare a cable release, attach it on the camera, and use it to keep the shutter curtain open at bulb shutter. Remove the back cover and put a frosted sellotape on the back (Scotch MagicTape would do). Make sure the tape is attached evenly and flat. Use a tripod to fix the camera at the same position. Open up the aperture all the way so light would come in easily. Now try to focus the double image in the viewfinder at an object and then look at the tape to determine whether the image on the tape is also focused. Do this at the closest, mid, and the farthest distances to ensure the coupling is correct.

3. The flimsy way: use a tripod to fix the camera, use a tape measure to measure the distance from the focal plane and an object, try to focus the lens at the object in the viewfinder, and see whether the distance on the lens and the actual distance are the same.

Question 4 is going to be a bit complicated based on what your future needs are as well as whether or not you wear glasses.

lljersk,Interesting-Quit-847,"Lens manufacturers that made LTM lenses include: Leica, Canon, Nikon, Voigtlander, Zeiss, and many others.   They will also work fine on a M mount Leica with the appropriate adapter.

The most classic 50mm on a screw mount Leica is the 50mm Elmar 3.5. I have one that came with my IIIc and I'd assumed that I'd replace it, but no, it's very good for a 75 year old lens. I'm intrigued by the Nikkor 50mm 2.0. I'll probably try that one next. 

My Canon 35mm 2.0 is very good. If I ever try another it will 100% be because the aperture ring is too close to the lens hood.

Voigtlanders are well regarded, but many of them have an issue where haze developed between lens elements, so it's a minefield. (I'm repeating internet hearsay).

Lenses: voigtlander color skopar series (They have a 35mm and 50mm and a 28mm and a 90mm). They come in LTM. Lens light lab have some retro design lenses like the 50mm elcan and 35mm eight element that can come in a LTM mount. 

You do not 'need' an eyepiece using a 90mm lens. The M4 has framelines for the 90mm. You might want one to use for a Barnak to help with framing, but it will take a bit of a learning curve to understand where the framelines don't match.",1,1725497186.0,2024-09-05 00:46:26,,0,1f8zewj

I am reluctant to recommend a specific adapter because there are too many stories about small issues. Voigtlander usually gets a good reputation. Lens light lab often includes a M-mount adapter with their LTM lenses. But a lot of chinese manufractures have their own adapters too. Most work well. Some work well enough. And there are a few that are problematic. here is a guide written by cameraquest - [https://www.cameraquest.com/adaptltm.htm](https://www.cameraquest.com/adaptltm.htm)

lm2j833,OnePhotog,"M lenses won‚Äôt adapt to a ltm mount because of the lenses nodal point.  

The nodal point is designed into the physical properties of the lens. It has to be a specific distance from the film. Ie. When the distance is at infinity, the focal length is the same as the distance between the nodal point and film plane.  The m mount is too thick to fit on the camera body.  For the m mount lens to fit, you would have to hack metal off the m Mount lens and bits of the barnak camera to fit the m mount lens. That amount of metal removal ruins both the camera and lens. 

Ltm lens mount onto m mount cameras because ltm lenses are smaller. We can add a bit, by way of an adapter, to make the nodal point fit more mount camera.  

Here is a more extreme experiment.  You have a slr lens.  It typically has a longer nodal point to make room for the mirror and internal electronics found in a slr.  When you mount the slr lens to a m mount leica, the adapter is longer to simulate the distance seen in the slr camera.  This in also why m mount lenses cant be hacked onto slrs. M mount lenses are not designed to me mounted so far from the film sensor.  The exception, one guy adapted a leica m mount 50mm 0.95 lens onto a canon 5d by removing the guts and mirrors on the slr camera.  It wont be mounting any more ef slr lenses after that conversion.

Thankfully I'm able to pay for it using money I had set aside for a rainy day, but now that I'm going over things in my head I'm wondering if this was such a good idea.

Yes it needs a cla but, replacing the vulcanite is cake, clean the fuck out of the body with a damp but not wet micro fiber and just the tiniest bit of dish soap.

Replace the vulcanite before cla if you want and feel confident. Quite a few places will sell you pre cut leatherette. Get something custom and unique for you to make it yours. 

You could even replace/ repaint the engravings fairly easily - I like to do this for almost all of my cameras.

It was the first that by standard came in a black coating, earlier crons were chrome coated, it has a very long focus travel, making it slower (but also more precise) to focus and it has a different formula. Meaning it renders differently than previous and later versions.

The V4 was a new design again, but it is probably the most loved version.

V5 is the current version. Its lenses are identical to the v4, proving the great design of the v4.

In general: the V3 is a very nice little lens. Just because some prefer the V4 and others prefer the V2 does not mean it is bad in any way. and you got it for a great price.

The most important sentence from this review:¬†""*Sure, the V3 might not stack up when compared to its siblings, but when compared to every other fifty in the world it proves to be one of the best in the category.""*

And here to understand, why many prefer V2 and V4/V5 for some reasons: [Dan Kerin on the V3](https://dankerinphotography.com/leica-50mm-f2-summicron-v3)At Dan's homepage you can also find his opinions on V2 and V5 (=V4)

llecy3n,AnonymousBromosapien,"If you are worried about longevity then whats the difference? Whether its an M10 this month, M240 for the next 3 years then an M10, M240 for the next 6 years then an M11 for $5k? Why not just slowly put money aside and run your M240 until it dies, then buy an M10 or whatever when that day comes. Your M240 could die next week... or last another 12 years... who knows. So unless you are compelled to move on from it for some other reason beyond longevity that is not expressed here... whats the difference?

>just stick with the m240 until its worth nothing. 

As in broken? Or are you suggesting the M240 in general will be worth nothing at some point in the relatively near future? Seing as how like 2 years ago they were $800-1,000 cheaper than they are right now... as an already 12 year old camera, its pretty safe to say itll be a very long while before they are worthless. Shit, M9s with sensor corrosion are older and still going for good money lol.

But having said that, it also isnt a bad time to sell an M240 lol. Prices are higher now than they have been in the past 2 years.

In my opinion, I think its sorta silly in general to offload an M240 just for an M10. They are very similar and even have the same resolution sensor. I would say its not really worth it unless you are going to an M10-R or newer... because whats the point? Sell a 24mp M for a few year newer 24mp M...

To each their own I suppose. Personally, I wouldnt bother and would rather just buy an M11 and keep my M240, or wait and see what they have in store for the M12. But I also never sell any cameras so there is that lol. I bought my M240 in like 2013 and plan to use it until the wheels fall off, then have it repaired if possible, buy an M(whatever) is the hot new M while its in the shop, then retire the M240 to the shelf for one of the kids to use.

>Should I get out now and painfully spend 3k extra for an M10

Im also kinda curious how you are valuing your MP 240 and M10s?? Selling an MP 240 and youll still need and extra $3k to get an M10? Either you are over valuing M10s or severely under valuing your MP 240.",18,1725412829.0,2024-09-04 01:20:29,,0,1f8fs9n

Remember that years ago, people were producing amazing photos with the M240, so that says something. I still have my M240 and while not everyone ""loves"" the M240 look, I find it has a unique look (I had M9, M9M, M10, M10P, and currently also have M10D and M10M, SL and Q), similar to how the M8/9 had a unique look over the M240 and how the M10/11 have a look that's different from M9, M240 and M10/11)

The M240s are also tough bastards, and if you can get a good deal on one and a handful of batteries, I'd wager you'd be good for a few more years. The upside is that demand for M240 isn't particularly high, so you'd likely score a good price for a 240",3,1725444614.0,2024-09-04 10:10:14,,0,1f8fs9n

Something about the way the sensor is tuned in the Epson still results in incredible pictures. One of the biggest benefits over the M8 coming from experience having owned an M9 alongside the R-D1, is ISO performance. Even straight out of the camera JPEGs at the max of ISO 1600 are absolutely usable, pleasing even, over the M8/M9 whose images at ISO 800 are bordering on unusable.

That's to say nothing of the handling of both cameras, the R-D1 feels like something wholly unique. The manual shutter cocking, and analogue dials that render the (admittedly impressively usable for 2004) LCD screen unnecessary, really do add something to the shooting experience.

I shoot it like unlimited film and almost never check the screen and there are very few shots it missed (mainly in high DR situation that the Leica probably would have missed too). Cocking the shutter is a fun and unique experience if you like having something to connect you to the camera more. The RD-1 has cleaner digital noise as you up the ISO than the M8, especially when it comes to color. In B&W, they both perform great in my opinion.

llbyhjv,ggAlex,"Very cool set up. I have an M-Rokkor 40mm which is supposedly the same lens. I think you'll be pleased with it. It's a super sharp lens above f4, and even down to f2.4 it is still respectably sharp. The dropoff from f2.4 to f2 is large with loss of contrast and sharpness, so I only shoot at f2 as a last resort when the light is low. The lens also flares easiliy, but I find it to be a unique and beautiful flare. About half of the time it shows up I'm actually glad.

Regarding rangefinder focus, here are a few tips and notes from my experience.

1. Remember to reframe after you find your focus. My first roll came back with all of my subjects dead center in the frame even when that didn't make sense, just because I was so excited to achieve focus I'd hit the shutter right away. A lot of people's heads had too much space above them in my shots.
2. Consider modding your summicron-c with a summicron-m focus tab. I bought my focus tab from the ebay link included in [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/1act39a/modifying_the_focusing_tab_on_a_40mm_minolta_m/), and I sent the lens away to a trusted repair shot to install. It is WAY more pleasant to use the traditional focus tab shape vs what comes by default on the summicron-c. You can also ask them to mod the lens to bring up the 35mm framelines. I did this part myself. The 35mm framelines on the M6 are much closer to a 38mm. They do this so that you are more conservative in your framing. They'd rather your 35mm lens capture slightly more than what you saw in your viewfinder, just in case. This works out great for 40mm shooters, as you can use the 35mm lines and just assume you're getting a tiny bit less than the lines suggest.
3. Learn to isolate your subjects with framing instead of wide aperture. A rangefinder is a less precise focus mechanism, so will want smaller apertures to increase your focus depth, increasing your chances of nailing focus. You'll also find that the shutter speed dial jumps in full stop increments, so it is hard to dial in your exposure with shutter speed, which then means you'll be fine-tuning exposure with your aperture dial. To me, shooting with an M sometimes feels like shooting in shutter priority ‚Äì I'll usually set my shutter for the scene I'm in, and there are usually 3 options (250, 500, 1000) because I'm trying to reduce the effect of camera shake and subject motion blur. That means my shutter is known and my aperture is usually floating around. After a few rolls I noticed lots of nailed focus, albeit with lots of stuff in focus. I still wanted isolated subjects so I started adjusting my framing.

I think you're in for a fun journey. Shooting with a rangefinder completely changed my photography style for the better. Now I can't go back to SLRs.",3,1725382766.0,2024-09-03 16:59:26,,0,1f7qluq
llcjvqv,AltruisticCover3005,"With a bit of training you can focus a rangefinder as quickly as an SLR, but you will quite often have to recompose, because you might not want your point of focus in the center. So it will be slower, often.

If you need to be quick, don‚Äòt bother too much with rangefinder, but stop down and zone focus. I mostly stopped using ISO100 film with 35 mm cameras for that exact reason, slow film is for tripod use with my medium format cameras.",3,1725389591.0,2024-09-03 18:53:11,,0,1f7qluq

They‚Äôre so compact and they just feel amazing. I‚Äôve since sold the M6 and switched the Leica MP (Mechanical Perfection). You learn to trust what you see in viewfinder. The MP has a bigger and brighter viewfinder. Some folks upgrade the viewfinder on an M6 with the MP viewfinder.

Internals look OK (some of the components exposed in the IIIa are covered in later models). Does the wind-on mechanism work normally without film loaded? Are there any chips of old film visible in the take-up spool clip or elsewhere? 

If there's nothing obviously absent or non-functional, follow the loading instructions carefully. Lots of YouTube videos get this a bit wrong, so read the instructions. Although you have a IIIa, I think the directions are clearest in the IIIf manual:

[https://www.cameramanuals.org/leica\_pdf/leica\_if\_iif\_iiif.pdf](https://www.cameramanuals.org/leica_pdf/leica_if_iif_iiif.pdf)

The loading instructions start on p27. It's very important to trim the film leader to the profile shown on p29. You can do this with a sharp knife and a trimming template. The original is the metal ABLON, which collectors have made very expensive, but there are plastic versions on ebay etc. Alternatively, do what many of us do and use a small pair of scissors. Cut between and not across sprocket holes and round off the corner (there shouldn't be any damaged holes). Leave about 23 sprocket holes 'unpaired'.",1,1725625627.0,2024-09-06 12:27:07,,0,1f8b1xv

Whether with my R4s or adapted to my SL the Elmarit 28 is the one I get the most use out of. I recently took it, the Summicron 50, and Vario Elmar 28-70 with me for a two week trip to England and shot 80% of everything with that lens. If I want to go tighter I usually go Summicron 50. 

The Elmarit 90 is an amazing portrait lens. I use it for a lot of my paid work and everyone loves the way it looks. The 135 is rarely used but is another fantastic lens. 

The Elmarit 35 may not be as fast as the Summicron or the bokeh king Summilux 35, but wow is it a great lens. I‚Äôve been using it a lot recently and have had a hard time shooting anything other than that lens. Same 3D pop as the Summicron 50, but with a totally different rendering and focus falloff. Sharper than the Summicron 50 as well. 

I think the Vario Elmar 28-70 is such an underrated lens. There is some visible barrel distortion at 28, but is easily corrected in Lightroom with digital photos or negative scans. The distortion, however is really only visible when there are straight lines at the very center of a composition at 28. Otherwise it‚Äôs not noticeable.

ll6q0rn,fineYogurtAndBerries,"So these... somehow I had to do it. Over time, I found a place for each of them, and I don't get tired talking myself into needing (and thus keeping) them all.

Here are the reasons (or whatever makes me do it), left to right:

* M10 + Noctilux 50 f1: I started with the original M10 and the Summilux first, and thanks to some fellas here and some really nice shots out there, I could not resist against the Noctilux. It's heavy, yes, and I don't care. Also, the 24MP are ideal for this lens. Love the colors and the images in general that come out of it.
* M10 Monochrom + Summilux 35 ASPH non-FLE. I got the 35 before the Mono, and usually, I put the 50 Lux on this camera. The Mono + 35 combination gives me almost medium-format look, and I am on that trip right now. I got the Monochrom because I was rarely shooting (or more precisely, converting to) B&W. No cheating allowed on this one, and I love it. Using the 50 Lux ASPH on this one, you get a scary amount of detail.
* M10-R + Summilux 50 ASPH. Oh well. As I said, the 50 Lux was my recent entrance into the Leica world, and I usually sport the 10-R with the 35mm Lux. It's the most versatile combination, you can take it anywhere, crop if you really need to, and you get slightly different colors than out of the original M10, even after editing it's not 100% the same. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I like both.

Don't roast too heavily... at least the batteries are the same on all three...(see? talking myself into it)",17,1725302618.0,2024-09-02 18:43:38,,0,1f7eef1

I sold both of those, as the 560 with its pistol grip and shoulder stock looked too much like a rocket launcher to be comfortable using it in public and the 800-R was just too big. Fine for birders used with a really heavy tripod but not for me. I have a modular Zeiss Tele-Tessar 300/600/1200mm, which is far lighter and more compact. I use it on my M digital cameras with a Novoflex LEM-CONT adapter. I was amazed how much I got for the 800 mm Telyt lens from a Japanese buyer. I also have the catadioptric MR-Telyt 500-R, which is surprisingly good and the annular bokeh does not bother me too much. I can double that up with a 2x APO Extender.

ll5minz,lexusuk,"Better image detail on the Q3 due to the 61MP sensor. Definitely way better auto focus on the Q3 as well. And obv tilt screen is occasionally handy. The view finder is a lot better on Q3. Also the power switch is WAY better on the Q3. The Q3 is amazing in low light as well. To the point where you can just easily take shots in very low light and it's surprising that the images come out so well with relative ease. So a general small improvement in all areas.

In use the main difference is that the Q3 has different buttons in new positions and you sometimes have to use touchscreen which I very much don't prefer. Also the Q3 firmware has been medium buggy so far but they keep releasing updates so hoping for that to improve over time.

I think if you were printing at 5x7 or even 7x10 i doubt you could tell the images apart between the two cameras. For larger prints or pixel peepers you will appreciate the 61MP from the Q3.

Overall, i tend to take the Q3 if I want the best hit rate. For all the usability issues mentioned which are minor tbh once you've used it for a week or so I usually get better images with the Q3 overall. I keep the Q for times when there might be alcohol involved (bars, pubs, festivals etc) as a few times the Q has had shots and beer spilled on it. Not ready to put the Q3 through that kind of abuse yet. :D

Honestly though both are amazing. I fell in love with the Q when I first got it and just sold everything else I owned.

I would focus on taking test photos of things you usually photograph in the way you usually photograph them, and just take the same photo with each lens at the same exposure setting. If you usually shoot wide open, then test the lenses wide open, etc. Then compare the results to see if there is a discernible difference, and if there is an actual difference, which you prefer. For analysis it's helpful to always shoot the lenses in the same order so you can tell which is which later on.

Photographing a brick wall or a test chart might be useful if you‚Äôre planning on doing document scanning or other critical flat plane reproduction work, but it‚Äôs not terribly relevant if you plan on photographing people and places. 

Take both lenses out with you and try to shoot the same compositions with them. If you‚Äôre feeling especially fancy, you can take a tripod and a cable release to really control variables, but I‚Äôd probably just shoot hand-held, match the aperture, and swap lenses for each frame. Make sure to take notes so you know which is which. If you can, try to include some challenging pictures that might show off differences in performance more clearly (high contrast, low contrast, backlit subject, sun in the frame, busy background, close subject, infinity subject, etc.).

You have two excellent lenses, so both should perform well, but shooting a roll of comparisons like this should give you a sense of the real world differences between them.",3,1725307302.0,2024-09-02 20:01:42,,0,1f7eact

In addition, film is a slow process; so it may take you a few months to get to know both lenses and their characters.  I would shoot different rolls of the same film stock with each lens and just see which gives you nicer sharpness, bokeh, and feel.  I recommend shooting with some low iso film like acros100 or velvia 50 or 100 because those film stocks really make the lens character shine - you mentioned E100 and that should be great.

There's actually more to just tightening up things on these lenses anymore because they do have to be an absolute perfect alignment and if there's a floating element it complicates things. 

It really sucks to pick up a messed up lens and go to use it and realize you don't really have a replacement with you and you're wanting to shoot something.

Leica is 100% a luxury camera brand, so if you are going to get into it... anything less than getting exactly what you want is a complete waste of money that could be better spent elsewhere.

>My dream is to take photography seriously, and this is possibly the most affordable Leica product out there.

Just to reiterate... Leica is 100% a luxury camera brand. Having a Leica in no way inherently equates to *""taking photography seriously""*. Leica is basically for people who 1) Have a lot of disposable income, or 2) Have a lot of experience in photography, have other gear, and are looking for something beyond pure capablity... And typically both 1 and 2 together lol. Buying a Leica under pretty much any other premise outside of the two mentioned above is kinda foolish and not money well spent.

For example, for the price of a D-Lux 8 you can buy a used Nikon D850 and a used 50mm f/1.4G and make one of the most insane leaps in cameras coming from your T7 to a D850. Like the Nikon D850 is widely considered the best DSLR ever made... and anyone who knows cameras seeing a high school kid with one would be like *""dude... is that a D850?!""* lol.

I really dispise the D-Lux 8 because it does exactly what you are experiencing right now... people look up things like *""best camera brand""* and it leads them down the Leica rabbit hole and the next thing the know they are looking at all these $6k-$9k cameras and thinking to themselves *""wow... if I had a Leica everyone would be like daaammnnn""*. And then they come across the D-Lux 8, which as I said is aimed at doing exactly this... making people think *""Wow, I can get a brand new Leica for only $1,600?!""*... not realizing that its just a repackaged 6 year old Panasonic LX100 II.

By all means, if you really just want the red dot and dont care so much about how you spend your money, then go for it. But if this...

>it‚Äôs just not realistic financially for me at this point. Should I start with a different brand,

... is really something that weighs on your mind when it comes to spending this amount of money... then 100% your money would be better spent elsewhere. The things you could do when it comes to camera gear with the amount of money it would cost to buy a D-Lux 8 is insane. I was a grown man with kids when cameras like the D850 came out... already owning 4 Leicas at that point in time... and was fricken stoked to get my hands on a D850 lol. I couldnt even imaging being a high school student and owning a camera as capable and renowned as a D850.

But not to just endlessly toot the D850 horn... there are a shit ton of camera out there that you could get for the cost of a D-Lux 8 that would be awesome. Another that comes to mind off the top of my head is a Sony a7iii... psh, hell yea dude. But a D-Lux 8 aint it.

*(apologies to all my D-Lux 8 fans out there, not trying to invalidate your purchases or anything... just trying to help this kid best use their money)*",4,1725335259.0,2024-09-03 03:47:39,,0,1f7pmki

If you want more tactical experience, I‚Äôd recommend you get a Nikon ZF with a lens for about the same price as D-Lux 8. The manual focus assist on the ZF can almost resembles Leica Rangefinder methods. (Close enough).

ZF is capable of doing both most professional and casual use cases, the dial setup resembles the traditional way of adjusting ISO/Shutter-speed, you can also adapt M lenses (eg. voigtlander vm lenses) for developing a M mount lens-kit before getting the M6, you can also go for Viltrox lenses that are cheap and performs better than their price states.",2,1725341562.0,2024-09-03 05:32:42,,0,1f7pmki

ll9c1iz,atsunoalmond,"a very affordable and high quality alternative to an M6 would be a pentax spotmatic or pentax K1000, with the super takumar lenses. i think they take beautiful images. if you want to spend a bit more, look into the 8-element 50mm takumar lens. olympus film cameras are also worth looking at IMO (although i don‚Äôt know models / lenses as well). both myself and another photographer i highly respect started on pentax, then when we had enough money and were confident enough about our photography we invested in an M6 when the opportunity arose (good copy at a good price)

imo the highest priority when shopping for a camera is the lens and the sensor / color science. for digital, brand and camera model will dictate sensor / color science. but things get expensive pretty quickly in digital. so you can save some by going to film, and there is a lot of good lenses on cheaper platforms like pentax or olympus, without needing to spend 2-3k on a body. and those good lenses are often <$500 and would be largely comparable to a $1-3k leica M lens. the leica body and lenses are expensive bc there is a huge collectors market, so demand is sustained.",1,1725338342.0,2024-09-03 04:39:02,,0,1f7pmki
llajy8x,Augustwest100,"If you wanted to learn how to drive manual transmission, you would get an affordable ‚Äúbeater‚Äù car and start working the clutch. Do the same with photography for now. You will get more help here if you try to describe the type of photography you are most interested in practicing. Also ask yourself what specifically your current camera does not do for you. Be as specific as possible. There is so much good value out there. This is an advantage for you. Getting something relatively expensive right now is not necessary, though everyone here knows what you are experiencing right now in the desire to purchase a Leica.  People can start to learn photography from a plastic Diana camera. What the camera CAN‚ÄôT do: that‚Äôs where we come in! I am reorganizing my Lightroom catalog, and when scrolling through lots of old (mostly iPhone) photos of family, every once in a while a photo will stop me, and I will realize it is my Nikon D100 with a 17-55 f2.8. The lens is more important than the camera all other things being equal.  All that said, my photography skill took a huge bump DOWN when I picked up my first Leica more than a decade ago. With a lot of patience and a lot of missed shots, I have clawed my way back. So while it is probably not necessary for your next step in the journey to be an expensive camera of any brand, I will at least put in a plug for shooting a camera in full manual mode until you know what each setting does to the final image.

ll4jku7,Jhogg82,"The Leica M6 without a meter is not actually an M4, it‚Äôs an M4-P. Kinda pernickety, but in my experience, having owned an M6 and currently owning an M4, the classic Leica feel of the earlier models (quality, craftsmanship, smoothness etc.) is quite real. For all sorts of reasons (not least the meter, which got on my nerves, sometimes refused to turn off and regularly drained the battery), I did not bond at all with the M6 and in fact made a straight swap with someone for an M4 - maybe a bad deal for me financially, but I regret it not at all. If you don‚Äôt need a meter (and if you‚Äôre not shooting slides you don‚Äôt need a meter) and assuming the cameras are in similar condition, the M4 is a significantly more refined tool in my opinion. It is also eminently repairable. Same goes for the M2 - which I also own and recently have shot even more often than my M4. Having an entirely mechanical camera with no battery to worry about is for me the perfect antidote to our current gadget obsessed age. And I probably miss exposure less than when I used the M6 (which is a simple and far from foolproof implementation in any case). Oh and if you DO want to shoot slides, that is also totally possible with a meterless leica, just have a handheld incident meter.

For the price of an M6 you can get an M4 and a 50mm summicron, and that's one of the best combos I can think of.

I feel, if the objective is to create a lens that would fit the company's ethos,  in terms of design language, you can definitely argue thst leica m lenses are the best? but if you mean image output, comparing all lenses across the board from every brand, I'm certain it isn't the case. 
I generally believe leica m lenses are made to be small first and then they optimise the design (just look at the SL apo vs Leica apo)-->there are exceptions like your noctiluxes

is leica m always the best? that question is contentious because it really depends. look at the Leica apo vs voitlander apo, eg the 50mm -- the VM might have better performance at some areas that the Leica is poor at and they are the pretty similar in size too. but at some areas the VM is not as good. so what is the matrix for best? 

then you can also talk about vintage, with all its charm and nice rendering. they definitely can't compete with modern lenses but you will hear people swearing by the ""Leica glow"" and character that makes them great. however lenses from that era, tend not to be so ""over designed"" and perhaps other lenses from other systems do also give such beautiful qualities (zeiss, angenieux, nikon, schneider-kreuznach and the list goes on). there are also new lens manufacturers that are manufacturing lenses with ""vintage"" characters too. are they better or worse just because they aren't leica or because they didn't stood the test of time? are their vintage rendering inferior just because? in general, I don't think there will be an answer to this so test it and if you like it, use it.

unfortunately, the bias (for leica) will always be there imo. I think it is primarily driven because of the price and scarcity. my take is just try them on your own and whichever makes you like the image better or use the lens more often, then it is the best lens for you",4,1725293413.0,2024-09-02 16:10:13,,0,1f788eg

I haven't shot any Voigtlander or Zeiss on my Leica yet though, so they may have that same magic.     I have shot a ton of other lenses though and the Leicas are really, really beautiful.

I think one of the strengths of the Leica lens is the balance between sharp and not sharp places in the image.  There is something about the way the image goes from in focus to out of focus that is beautiful.    The Summilux 50 version 2 is a masterful lens in this area.

Also, they tend to give you a bit of a medium format look with landscapes and buildings that few other lenses do.  This tends to work even wide open.  I would recommend the Summicron 40 for this type of shot.

There is also the neutral color balance the Leica lenses tend to give.  The contrast is usually not so high, but still the photo is very sharp.  It is hard to describe, but something the Leicas I have do beautifully.

It is, and love it! In my opinion the easiest of the close focus lenses to use in terms of using the close focus range in fact. Due to the wider angle I‚Äôve found that when shooting subjects close, guesstimating that 0.4-0.6 area is often-times just a matter of filling the 28 framelines and as long as I‚Äôm just a tad stopped down it nails it.

I didnt say that you will be dependent... I said that their system fosters dependency.

>In the 25 years I‚Äôve been using Adobe products (apart from a short spell when I was sponsored by Capture One) I‚Äôve never had an issue with Adobe.

Ive been using Adobe products for about the same length of time, and have serious issues with Adobe. They have been historically profit first, customer second. And even as of recently are currently on the cusp of facing consequences for that.

https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-files-complaint-against-adobe-and-two-adobe-executives-alleged-violations

>Their subs model is very good value (C1 also have a subs model) and I pay less than ¬£100 for a year‚Äôs sub to LR and PS. To buy a licence to own C1 will cost three times that amount

Yes, and you have to continuously pay that subscription fee to retain access to the software. Whereas with C1 you can pay the perpetual license fee once and could potentially never have to pay it again. C1 gives customers a cumulative 20% discount on the cost to upgrade their perpetual license for every year since their kast upgrade. C1 is also cheaper in the long run. This breaks down like so *(in USD)*:

- Year #: Product = Total Cost

- Year 1: C1 = $299, LR = $120
- Year 2: C1 = $299, LR = $240
- Year 3: C1 = $299, LR = $360
- Year 4: C1 = $299, LR = $480
- Year 5: C1 = $299, LR = $600

Thats just in 5 years... in 10 year Lightroom has cost a user 4x the amount Capture One has cost a user.

Also some key takeaways to that... Because you own your perpetual license of Capture One, you can just stop using it without worrying about a routine monthly expense. Additionally, with their upgrade discounts, yes, every 5 years you can literally uograde for free to the newest iteration of the software. Of which you can literally do indefinitely.

>in a year‚Äôs time it will be ready for upgrade, which means you will pay again or stay with obsolete software.

Obsolete software? Ive been a photographer for decades...I havent upgraded my Capture One in like 3 years, I have no problem doing the things I need to do with my current version of the software lol.

>C1 is very complicated to use and the output quality is different to Adobe.

Complicated? I disagree. I used Lightroom for a very long time before switching to Capture One... is it different? Obviously. But complicated? Not in the slightest... And as I mentioned to the OP, if you havent already acclimated to another software, then adjusting to C1 wont be any mote difficult that learning LR from the start. Or any other software for the matter. Difficult for someone who has used LR for a decade? Yea... navigating things took some getting used to, but its not just inherently more complicated than any other editing software.

If you want to just rent your photo editing software... then by all means, stay with Lightroom, it makes no difference to me. I switched to Capture One many years ago and I couldnt be happier. $299 up front to never have to worry about a stupid recurring subscription again is awesome. 

Personally, I couldnt imagine renting a software endlessly just to be left with nothing the day you stop paying them. Pay once, never pay again, easy peezy.",1,1725266881.0,2024-09-02 08:48:01,,0,1f6t2dj
ll36r59,AnonymousBromosapien,"If you dont really have any experience with Lightroom, going straight into Capture One will be pretty easy for you. I think one of the more considerable deterrents for a lot of people is that they are already so used to Lightroom, so they dont want to have to get used to navigating a different software. I know that kept me away from switching for a while at least lol.

But full disclosure, I have decades of experience with Adobe products, and have use Lightroom and photoshop for well over a decade. I just ended up being absolutely fed up with having to constantly pay for it, and that is what lead me to look elsewhere and ultimately finding out about Capture One. So my distain for Adobe isnt just some form of tribalism... Adobe has gotten plenty of my money lol.

Capture One is very reputable though, they arent some one-off software... they have been around since the 90s. Its every ounce as capable as Lightroom, and they have perpetual licenses, so you just buy it once and whatever version thatbis out at the time you purchase is the one youll have and be able to use forever without paying another cent. 

You can also register that perpetual license on up to 3 different PCs at a time. The 3 licenses can easily be deactivated on any given system and reactivated on another one if you get a new PC or something... as many times as you want. 

Then if they release a new feature that you want any time after youve purchased your perpetual license, you can upgrade your verison of the software at a big discount. Which increases like every year since youve last bought/upgraded the license. The discount rate is 20% per year... so per their loyalty program, if you dont updrage yoir perpetual license for 5 years you literally get the newest version of the softwate for free. So you could technically buy it once and never pay another doller of it again if you dont mind waiting.

Your comparison doesnt even make sense either. Renting a car is wholly different. Nobody rents a car knowing that it is something they are going to need to use for the foreseeable future. It would be more closely associated with leasing a vehicle, but with absolutely no option to buy at the end of your lease terms. 

I.e. You have to agree to pay for this thing every month for a long time, and then your term is up you either stop paying for it and say goodbye to it, or you just lease another vehicle and just continue to pay for things youll never own.

When it comes to streaming services such as Netflix and Spotify... yea, I have a rational expectation to not be able to own every movie or song ive ever watched/listened to for a one time price. But photo editing software is not a streaming service either... so this comparison doesn't make any sense. 

If I only wanted to listen to Led Zeppelin or watch the Star Wars original trilogy it would unquestionably be more advantageous in the long run to buy those movies and albums than it would be to pay for Disney+ and Spotify every month for the rest of my life.

>New camera? New OS? These can make your three year ownership model obsolete overnight.

This is just not true... I dont need direct camera support dowm to the camera's exact firmware to be able to edit photos on Capture One... or Lightroom... or any ohoto editing software. So I dont even know what point you are attempting to make here lol. Unless a camera manufacturer comes up with a brand new native RAW file format that doesnt exist today... there is nothing stopping a 3 year old version of Capture One from importing DNG, NEF, ARW, TIFF, etc... So idk where you are getting the above from. 

I also strongly believe I could abstain from buying a new camera for a year or two if it meant being able to upgrade Capture One for free... if thats what was necessary for some reason lol. Like my newest camera I own is a Fujifilm X-T4 or maybe my X100V, and I use my 12 year old M240 and my 7 year old D850 way more than either of those... so im not exactly drooling over every new realease. 

Either way, and as I said... You are free to do whatever you want, and if renting your photo editing software is you preference, then by all means. I personally enjoy owning my photo editing software. Paid once three years ago and havent thought about it since. I could not edit a single photo for the next 6 months and there wouldnt be a single dime wasted on my end lol. Cant say the same aboit Lightroom though.",1,1725290554.0,2024-09-02 15:22:34,,0,1f6t2dj

ll63yjl,AnonymousBromosapien,">So you are happy to stream music. You won‚Äôt own it but you are happy to pay for it.

Yes... I am happy to pay for a music streaming service that allows me to listen to any music I want, absolutely. Do you not even understand that you are drawing a false equivalency here? Music is a form of entertainment... You listen to it, and thats it. 
Whereas photo editing software is a utility/tool... these two things are inherently different. 

To add, it would be significantly more difficult for me to source and buy every song id want to listen to in a moment... so yes, a music streaming service is worthwhile. However, if you told me that I could own every song that exists on Spotify today for a one time cost equivalent to 3 years worth of a monthly subscription... yea, id absolutely opt for that. Are you telling me you would not? Can you honestly say youd just not chose that option? Like come on, thats the difference between LR and C1.

If you had an indefinite need for a hammer, would you rent a hammer indefinitely or buy it? What about a musical instrument? How about a vehicle? Or a home?

Point being, as I outlined a few comments ago... In the long term its always more cost effective to own than it is to rent. There is a point with everything where renting becomes less cost effective... with Lightroom its as soon as 3 years and no farther than 5 years. You wouldnt rent a car for 10 years, or a hammer for 3 years, or if you only listen to Led Zeppelin you wouldnt pay for Spotify for the rest of your life... 

Idk why you are having such an adverse reaction to this, but its obvious we disagree on a fundamental level here... and as I said, you are free to do whatever you so chose. I was simply offering OP options, if you disagree with those options then that fine, but you arent changing my mind lol.

ll30a5p,OnePhotog,"The pin in the camera shot shoe just sends a signal to say, ""flash now!""

Everything else is guided by the flash.

I use the Leica SF 24D for the auto thrystor. I can set the camera settings on the flash - the base camera settings is a good starting point (i.e. Film speed - 400, Aperture f/8 and shutter at 1/50). Then I copy those settings on to the flash (film speed 400 and aperture F/8). The flash tells me the maximum distance the flash power can reach. The flash controls how much power it needs to output. There is a little meter inside the flash, once there is enough light to fill the meter reading, it cuts the power off the flash. It is as close as automatic as it gets. If I need more distance or want to make the subject brighter, I can quickly just change the aperture on the camera to f/5.6)

Alternatively, simplier flashes just out put the power set. You can create a chart for each power level, the flash correctly exposes for a specific distance. I.e. at 1/2 power, subjects at 2 meters will be correctly exposed. From there, everything comes down to stops. situtation A. The subject is a standing at 1.5 meters. I can reduce the power to 1/4, or close the aperture down one stop - but not both. Situtation B. The subject is a little further at 3 meters away. I can increase the power of the flash or open up the aperture. 

There is a simple math formula that makes the calculation quick and easy to estimate on the fly.  I use a system of stops. Aperture, flash power, iso (i.e. digitally or push / pull processing) can be adjusted to compensate for changing variables. One stop adjustment means you adjust in another area. Aperture - just use the aperture readings on your lens. Each is one stop. (F/2 - 2.8 - 4 - 5.6 - 8 - 11 - 16). Another way to notice is that when you double the value (F2 to F4 or F5.6 to F/11) it is acutally two stops. Inbetween is one stop. Flash power. doubling or halfing the power is one stop. (Full power - 1/2 - 1/4  - 1/8  -1/16 / 1/32) Distance. like aperture, doubling or halfing the distance is two stops. (i.e. 1 m, - 1.5m - 2.3m - 3m ) I'm guessing. because my math isnt great. For one stop further than 1.5 meter I really just guess. I start by doubling 1.5m to 3m. I find the middle, which i guesstimate is 2.3m.  

Godox flashes were a great way to practice. Set a power. Set a distance. Set an aperture. Shoot everything at that specific distance and aperture setting. I can use that to adjust the exposure to my flavour.",1,1725241991.0,2024-09-02 01:53:11,,0,1f6ksfj

Simcity: ‚ÄûA bit sketchy‚Äú is an understatement. 

Unless you buy new at MK @ Simcity, most stores at that place, all Good Friend especially(!) have an explicit zero returned zero warranty policy. And they are overpriced too. All good friend is now Simcity based, the ChampCourt location - as me having been there yesterday - is fully shut down. 
Rangefinder is nice but very expensive - don‚Äôt buy anything that‚Äôs in a shop in TST - that applies here.

- Another ok place is CameraluxHK in Mongkok. At least they register their sold camera w Leica, unlike Simcity. 

- best service imho while a wife array of interesting pieces is in Causeway Bay: LSK Limited (near the official Leica store), + Meteor Hk, right at exit F of the Causeway Bay MTR.

Tokyo will always be cheaper on the used market (Mapcamera/Kitamura) than all the hk stores. The Tokyo stores have superb quality management standards for their products and they usually sell w some form of warranty. + tax free, it‚Äôs a no brainer

llfcc3a,mmmoctopie,"I appreciate you saying it, it‚Äôs all good. It‚Äôs very big of you to be able to come back to a thread like this and reflect.

I will get it looked at, yes. I‚Äôve been travelling a lot this summer though, and I didn‚Äôt really have a big enough gap to really send it away without missing an opportunity to take photos on a family trip. When I‚Äôm travelling with my family that‚Äôs the priority and the whole reason I invested in Leica - getting photos we can all look back on someday with a camera that‚Äôs not too bulky. Until then I‚Äôll continue dealing with the annoyances that come up.

I get your point that not all tech is flawless and there will be some issues and I inevitably will have to go back to the manufacturer. But it‚Äôs annoying as a customer who has paid for something to have to do that. 

And to me these don‚Äôt seem like HW flaws, they seem like genuine bugs in the software or something. Frustrating as the issue is almost never related to optics but more the other new bits (USB C etc). I really rely on Leica, their cameras are meant to go anywhere and shoot anything. They‚Äôre built like a tank, go to war zones and all that - take the M9 for example, I could rely on it 1000% to be ready to shoot the instant I brought it up to eye level to get the shot. I actually don‚Äôt have the same faith in the M11 unfortunately.

The M11 in theory has a bunch of new conveniences on top of it, but the conveniences do not seem fully ironed out. As in, they‚Äôre not very convenient if I have to worry about updating to the latest firmware (I have by the way) or worrying if the battery is going to drain or not. 

Anyway this is a long way of saying that yes I will get it looked at. Perhaps it is part of the freezing or something.

lkzyenl,redisburning,"you're already bringing too many lenses IMO. also a noct for travel? well, you do you, maybe youre like 6'4"" or something where it's not that big.

I agree that 35mm is probably not wide enough, but my experience in NYC is that 28mm is. NYC has wide streets and you'll find that most of the NYC street shooters are using 28mm; but both the 24 elmar and 21 super elmar would be solid choices if you don't think so though, again IMO.

final IMO, I dont see the value in the 21 summilux for this purpose. are you going to be shooting with it at night? if not, it's just a massive thing to lug around and I'm not sure that separation is what I would personally be going for in a parade. with the 21SEM you can just put it on f8 and point the camera vaguely in the direction of stuff and be happy. Id recommend an external finder if you go 21, 24 you can get away without having one if you don't wear glasses or spend the time to get good estimating it.",3,1725203229.0,2024-09-01 15:07:09,,0,1f64n62

Obviously it‚Äôs not the exact same lens as the stand alone Leica 28mm (I believe that one has a wider aperture fully open).

lkv591c,No_Rain3609,"Oh it's 100% a better camera than the Panasonic D-Lux or many other cameras. 
Just the lens isn't that expensive likely, ofcourse we can't tell because it's not sold as a single lens. 
But it also wouldn't be very good as a single lens, like I said it needs a lot of in body corrections.
I love the Leica Q that I bought but I knew these things before buying it.
I've tested out some cheaper Leica lenses like the 35mm f2.5 lens for the M mount. I used it on my Panasonic S5IIX and the image quality is much higher than anything I'm getting on the Q1 (based on the lens).

I'm just hearing people say very often that the lens on the Leica Q is the same as the legendary 5-6k Leica lens (I'm so sorry I forgot the name but I think it even is F1.4)
I just think everyone started saying it even it's not true at all, the lens on the Q is much worse but still not bad at all and a great lens, its definitely better than my Panasonic lenses for sure and I would guess it would be standalone in a price category of 1-2k (which isn't cheap at all but cheap for a Leica)

I think the Leica Q1-3 are totally worth it if you want a Leica point and shoot, and want something with quality.
Can you get similar performance from other brands without paying as much? You can 100% but ofcourse not the D-Lux.
I think the reason why people buy a Leica is not focused on getting the best value for money, Leica is an experience and a category of its own. 
They produce very high quality cameras manufactured in Germany with good wages for the workers, that alone bumps up the price.
Leica mostly doesn't shy away from delivering the best optical quality possible for whatever price.

Leica is an amazing brand and I can highly recommend getting one. 
There are tons of reasons that speak for buying a Q, that the lens costs standalone 5-6k just feels like trying to justify the purchase.

ll7493v,No_Rain3609,"I am not allowed to post an image here in the comments, can I send it to you somewhere?  
I have some test shots from the Leica Store.

I'm also honestly not interested about arguing here.  
If you want to believe that the Leica Q lens is worth 5-6k, it is up to you.  
There is literally no right or wrong because you can not buy it standalone and a price doesn't exist.  
I personally think that if a lens is as heavily distorted as the Q (without the corrections) it just simply isn't worth the money standalone and I would even argue one of the worst M lenses.  
The thing that changes everything around again is:

1. The camera does correct the lens in body, it still has some distortion even with that (The camera body even does a crop to hide parts of the edges that are unfixable) This makes this lens very usable and makes it work great together with the camera. It has some great qualities and also the Bokeh is really nice. But this lens would still be pretty bad standalone (It doesn't exist tho) Clearly The Lens and body where made for eachother.
2. Most important thing about this lens in my opinion: It is a leaf shutter lens. This is so awesome for many many reasons, especially for me also the flash sync speed. That is just amazing, also the sound is crazy quiet, so it is perfect for reporting.

I want to make it clear again, I do love this camera and I do recommend it for anyone interested.  
But stop trying to justify the purchase by saying the lens is 5-6k standalone.  
The camera has soooo many good reasons to be bought, and yes the lens is great too thanks to the corrections by the camera, not nearly as perfect or good as some other M mount lenses, but this is not the point of this camera. It is literally the best point and shoot on the market.  
This camera was never supposed to rival the M mount lenses, it is in it's own category and it is doing great there.

I am working professionally in photography and I honestly do not care about what MTF charts say.  
(working professionally also doesn't make me a technical expert but I have eyes to judge the Images side by side)  
I'm not picking my equipment based on some test charts but real world performance.  
If the Q wouldn't be such a fun and good camera to bring along, I simply wouldn't have bought it.  
But I am honest and saying that other Leica M lenses have much better optical performance than the one on my Q (without corrections and honestly even with).

Like I said I'd be happy to show you just one or two examples if you want to.  
I just do not know how to send them.

lkxnb9m,AnonymousBromosapien,"Just stick with the X100V.

The outcomes of renting a Q3 dont really ha mve any benefit to you... You either;

- Get halfway through the trip and realize the Q3 is much larger than the X100V and its not as convenient for you to deal with, realize you miss the film sims and there is nothing you can do about it now, or realize youve got this mountain of RAW files youll have to wade through editing when you get back... and subsequently be upset that you didnt just stick with a camera you are familiar with.

*OR*

- Realize you really love the Q3 and when yoi get home its going to ruin your X100V for you and now you have this very expensive camera on your mind every time you pick up your X100V.

Basically, unless you are trying it to see if you want to buy it... there is really no point in renting a Q3 for this trip. The negatives far exceed the positives... so much so that even if you do end up learning that you love the Q3, if say you cant afford it, that positive becomes a negative as well.

I have a q2 and love it. It‚Äôs an amazing tool, but it sounds like you‚Äôre looking for an excuse to get the shiny toy. Resist it. Make the best pictures with the objectively phenomenal camera you‚Äôve already got for several tens of thousands more exposures. And then maybe consider a Q.

lkxsdjp,mmarsbarr,"I've had the x100v for many years and prior to that came from previous x100s and the X Pro cameras.

I enjoy the experience of shooting with the Fuji far, far better and the colours from JPGs I used to get out of them was nicer. However what lets it down is shooting higher isos like 800 and beyond, it depends what your threshold for digital noise is and whether you like that look or not.

I then bought the q3 and took it on my first few travel trips, a few things that are FAR better: the image sharpness is stunning, the dynamic range holds well throughout the iso range, the high isos are cleaner, the ability to crop and still retain details from that sharp lens is fantastic. I also now am able to use it for some of my work whereas i could never really use the fuji for work.

I definitely miss the subjectively nicer colour jpg profiles from the fuji but in all honesty, it doesn't take much to edit those back in with the leica files and there is so much lattitude isn those files too.

If its going to be a special trip like Icecland, I say try and get the q3, but the x100v is really not bad at all if that is your only option, like i said i travelled extensively when i had the x100v and it was a nice smaller, lighter camera but the overall quality is definitely nicer with the leica, and this is coming from someone that doesn't think much of the Leica brand...",1,1725162430.0,2024-09-01 03:47:10,,0,1f63qo4

Leica bluestein is my favourite camera I think but can't find anywhere to have bought it haha. Since I can't have that, I bought a Leica MP Black Paint to have something a little different to this.

On the sharkskin plan. Are you referring to the cover that the earlier MP's had? If so, you may want to try to handle a sharkskin MP first. It's very cheap feeling.

Interesting is also that for the 1.2, I do feel I get two lenses for the price of one as it draws out differently wide open (it has a nice swirly bokeh) and when stopped down F2 onwards.

You can shoot flash just fine with a classic.  Your flash sync will be stuck at 1/50th. 

The reason people do like the ttl is because it allows the dial to rotate and feel similar to the digital camera.  Therefore, some people prefer the ttl dial for consistency with their digital m camera.  That being said, i think this doesn‚Äôt bother most people.

lktcn83,phipsix,"I came to the same question a couple months ago and decided to spend the extra money for the TTL. For me, the key differentiatiors were the better light meter --> instead of only the arrows you also have a dot that shows if your metering is spot on (i know, this might only be a small factor, but for me its a plus when it comes to the TTL) and the second, far more important one is the shutter speed dial, that is not only bigger (which makes it easier to use), but also goes in the other direction than with the classic one, which is just naturally easier to use. Also that you have the option to turn off the Light meter entirely, so the batery wont die when you just carry the camera in your bag is a plus imo. 

  
One thing you should also consider is, that you have different view finder options with the 0.58, 0.72 and 0.85 - which can help making a decision regaring your most used focal lengthes. I personally went with the 0.72 as I mainly shoot 35mm and that makes it easy to use.

There's also a 70mm Sigma but that is worse optically and has a shorter working distance. Panasonic 100 trades optical performance for smaller size, if that's very important.

Some of the telephoto SL lenses have decent magnification of 1:5 or 1:4, but that's not great for very small subjects. 

Other native options like Laowa and other Chinese brands are manual focus, which is not ideal for small animals and have weak flare resistance which can be problematic in uncontrolled lighting situations.

lkm1bd2,AnonymousBromosapien,"I have an absolute shit ton of cameras. I use my Q pretty much only when I want something for casual walking around and photographing. And even then, thats only if I really just dont want to carry around something heavier like an M or any other interchangeable lens camera.

For me, the Q will never be, nor was it ever meant to be, a replacement for an interchangeable lens system, or other fixed lens camera, or any other camera for that matter... its moreso an addition to. It just kinda is what it is... a premium fixed lens camera. Yea they cost a lot, but I honestly dont think I know a single person who owns just a Q and not one single other camera... its always a complimentary camera.

I.e. Whether or not you go into a Q purchase with the mindset that it will be your only camera... I feel like the reality is that there is an extremely high chance youll end up with another camera as well. I love my Q, and I actually love 28mm... but as a focal length it far from versatile. 

Even with a 60mp Q3, once you crop in to 50mm you are down to 19mp, 75mm and you are down to 8mp, and 90mm and you are down to just 6mp images... Some people are definitely ok with that, but for me... id much rather just throw an 85mm f/1.4 or 70-200mm f/2.8 on my D850 and take full advantage of the 46mp at any focal length. Or throw a 75mm or 90mm on my M and do the same and keep the Q at its native 28mm focal length.

Basically, my opinion is that the digital crop on the Qs is neat in a pinch, but in no way a feasible replacement for an interchangeable lens system, nor meant for routine use. So you either go into a Q purchase loving 28mm, look elsewhere for something more versatile, or be mentally prepared to buy another camera to compliment the Q.",9,1724985803.0,2024-08-30 02:43:23,,0,1f4hvrn

Would never consider the Q a replacement for this setup. 
 - It's less reliable AF-wise
- It has far less manual control (you cannot even freely set shutter speed in manual mode. The camera will limit your choices depending on iso)
- it babies you as if you were an imbecile (you are not allowed to deactivate high iso NR even if shooting RAW only)
- you cannot go wider than 28mm unless you shoot a panoramic image, but that's tough to do since the camera forces you to use the baked-in lens correction..
- you can crop images to get a tighter framing, but it does not equate to a shallow DOF when doing so. (it's roughly equal to a 50mm f/2.8 or 90mm f/4.5)

Where are you getting those numbers? Everywhere ive seen states them at 39mp @ 35mm, 19mp @ 50mm, 8mp @ 75mm, and 6mp @ 90mm. Maybe there is some missing information or something, but I havent seen anywhere that shows the numbers you mention. 

I think you may be looking at the crop factor associated with each digital crop at a given focal length on the Q3, and then using that to try and calculate expected megapixels at each focal length, but doing so doesnt so simply equate to effective megapixels. For example, Nikon has a 1.5x crop factor between FX and DX. My D850 is 46mp in normal FX mode... so if I put a 50mm lens on and shoot normally it would be 46mp, but in crop mode *(DX, which on a FX camera is a digital crop)*, its equivalent of 35mm focal length and only 19mp. 

If I try to assume the crop factor can simply be used to determine effective megapixels then I should be getting 31mp images shooting in crop mode... but thats not the case. I.e you cant use an associated crop factor to determine effective megapixels.

lko8lln,markSspiteri,"I post this here because of the content credentials feature on the M11P.  btw: I used my M262 with 35mm Cron V3.

A fellow photographer was with me when I took this photo. When I showed him the image, he asked me what I did to it in Lightroom/Photoshop. I guess he asked me because it looks different than what we saw and (if he shot it too) his image. He uses Fuji with film sims and prefers to get the final JPEG in camera.

I burned the left side (I'm old enough to call the masking and adjust process ""burned"") and messed with the colour sliders. Which is all that I've always done for personal work whether in the darkroom or in Lightroom/Photoshop. I may remove a spot with a heal tool, just as I would spot with ink on prints back in the days of old when print was the only vehicle.

I think that conversations around deep fakes and AI and knowing what's real are important discussions to have. As time passes, we'll be more and more able to spot deep fakes that look so real today in images that we make today. And those ""fakes"" will get better and better. I used to do stuff in the dark room for clients involving litho masks, which looked great at the time, but look lame today; downright cringy actually.

So, the question I have is; where is the line? What is considered OK and real enough and what isn't? I'm not talking about court evidence. I am talking about pictures we show for our art. I consider any conversation, whether visual or verbal, as 2-way; but if we post to the Internet, we don't know our audience or context. In a gallery we have a more specific viewer and we're able to position the work with write-ups or informed conversation. So, let's talk more about the images that we unleash to anyone and everyone in any context.",4,1725026261.0,2024-08-30 13:57:41,,0,1f4vwz2
lkol5pe,JapanKevin,"I guess the line varies by the person. I shoot both film and digital. I was raised during the Kodachrome era and I love the Kodachrome vibe. I hate the way a lot of digital images look, the clinical edges and especially some of the weird uniquely digital hues that digital casts. My Leica M11 is fantastic but it has a slight magenta cast straight out of the camera that always needs adjusting. So my aim is to adjust as little as possible while making it look like it was taken on Kodachrome. First I try to get the most accurate white balance off of something gray like a sidewalk, etc, using the dropper tool. Then use the histogram and balance out the highlights, lights, shadows, blacks, etc. Once I‚Äôve got all that, these days I use the Cobalt Kodachrome preset. 

That‚Äôs me, there‚Äôs no right or wrong way.  Some people make really fantastic looking images that look like fantasy art. Since I‚Äôm old school, my goal is to not jack with the image too much, limit retouching to the bare minimum, and focus on the composition and subject matter. If you have to spend more than a few minutes editing a photo, then the photo is probably lacking something.",1,1725030292.0,2024-08-30 15:04:52,,0,1f4vwz2
lkoam3c,hellomateyy,"For me personally, I try to just enjoy the photography and not ask too many questions. To me it's all different things, but all of it nice:

* Some picture look edited, but are in fact not. These I appreciate cause they caught something I didn't think was possible
* Some pictures look natural but aren't. These I appreciate cause the artist/photographer has done a great job
* Some photos look natural and aren't edited. These I appreciate cause they captured something nice

As a sidenote, there's the not nice I guess:

* Claiming something is unedited when it isn't",5,1725026929.0,2024-08-30 14:08:49,,0,1f4vwz2
lkoi6o4,markSspiteri,"I agree. As long as it's good. And, you decide what's good because it's your photo. If someone else appreciates it for any reason in any context; fantastic. I think that is the most common sentiment and I had wondered why Leica added this ""authentication"" feature for a select group of what I would consider ""purests"" (but that's another conversation). I.e. not enough people will upgrade because of this feature. But, in their communication they note that it has to do with the fact that the Leica M is so closely associated with photojournalism and documentary. And, I agree that it matters in that context.  Just wonder if we need to keep that in mind when releasing to the world without context. The image could end up in a place where it is perceived as ""real"". And, what's ""real"" and where's the line, or what criteria can we use?",1,1725029361.0,2024-08-30 14:49:21,,0,1f4vwz2

ll9nf5n,hellomateyy,"Read into it a bit, and as far as I can tell it‚Äôs got very little to do with allowing/disallowing some types of edits and/or ai tools during creation. It‚Äôs more about keeping an uneditable log/ledger of what‚Äôs been done to a photo. So if you see a photo of something that you doubt happened, you can check the log and see what‚Äôs been done to the image.

lkl1ftb,Soloist9323,"You can shoot at 32,000 and 50,000 easily with the M10M.  My auto iso is set to 32k max and the files are completely usable.

That said, noise reduction software is quite good and will only improve. If you want color, go with an M10-R and use noise reduction if you think you need to.",6,1724972413.0,2024-08-29 23:00:13,,0,1f4frz4
lkl0qnf,BangRossi,"I am quite confident using my M10-P up to ISO 10,000. For me, the image quality is still very usable. If you are using the M10M, you‚Äôll gain 1.5-2 stops over the M10. But honestly, even our eyes have a hard time distinguishing between green, blue, and red when it‚Äôs dark. So, the M10M is the way to go when you need a camera that can capture beyond -6 EV. If you occasionally need color at night, the M11 might be the better all-around choice, given its versatility and improved ISO handling compared to the M10-R. However, neither color model will rival the M10M‚Äôs dedicated low-light capability in monochrome.",3,1724972166.0,2024-08-29 22:56:06,,0,1f4frz4
lklxxoo,home_abroad,"Nothing beats the M10M at high ISO. I feel like it's more than 2 stops compared to my M10-R.  Even though I think it's got a lot of noise, the M11 has less banding when you start creeping above 12500 than the M10R though so it is a bit more usable at purely super high ISO.  So, if you want a color M above ISO 12500, get the M11.  If you want a monster at high ISO for color, check out the SL2-S.  Having said all that, color, even with these better sensors, starts to turn to garbage at high ISO and I always convert it to B&W anyway. . . .so, if you're going to keep the color Fuji for good light, then a Leica M10M would be an ideal addition as it is truly a special camera.  Plus, you can use your M lenses on your Fuji with adapter so you can carry both in your bag as they're both tiny setups and also get better reach (i.e. carry a 23mm Fuji lens and a 50mm M lens, I'd recommend the Voigtlander 50mm F2.2 Color Skopar cause it's so freaking small, and now you have a 50mm on your Leica and a 35mm and 75mm equivalents for your Fuji to cover quite a range).

lklc5ut,eudai_monia,"I have a Q3, Q2M, M11P and M11M.  The monochromes easily give you two additional stops of ISO and since the noise structure is grain-like and aesthetically pleasing, you can push them even further.  That said, the M11‚Äôs BSI sensor is excellent in low light and can shoot fairly clean at 25000 or higher in a pinch if needed.  In terms of low light capability, the order is M11M, Q2M, M11 and Q3.

The main reason people cite is the ability to use the color information for editing. For example you can make blues really dark and reds really light to imitate a red filter. On the q2m you need a physical filter for this.

lkn4i79,stbeye,"Not sure what you mean by ""beat"". Having the color sliders is convenient for some, others prefer filters.

In my case, I like the pure monochrome experience. Yes, the monochrome sensor has better low-light performance and resolves very nicely, but that's not relevant for me. I like the fact that removing the color option takes away another element of decision-making. If I take the monochrome (M11M in my case, although I have owned a Q2 and a Q2M before), I am committed to monochrome. I shot differently. And then when I come back and edit, not having the sliders to adjust the grey tone of each color individually makes my editing fast and simple. It all feels purer. It's a mental thing. 

To be honest, if you are unsure and like shooting color as well, just get a color sensor. The results of black and white converted color images are very good on the Q2.",1,1725007258.0,2024-08-30 08:40:58,,0,1f4kdi7

They‚Äôre also a little bit of a liability on digital (though reports vary considerably on how risky it is to use and/or collapse them on a digital M), but spectacular on film. While I‚Äôve used mine a bit on my M10, it tends to stay on my M4.

I also have a V5, which is probably the benchmark against which I judge other lenses. It‚Äôs less flare-prone than the collapsible version and the handling is better (especially with a permanent tab added by DAG). I love the built-in hood, and having 6bit coding is nice on a digital M. Color rendering is more modern and saturated than the collapsible lens (likely due to the coatings) and the corners are sharper, especially when stopped down, but the overall look feels very classic to me.

lkfwob5,Ready_Blueberry_6836,"I do think that you kind of miss out by getting the very best without first spending time in other cheaper gear and learning what kind of photography you like.  

If someone starts out buying a Leica without first having tried a DSLR, an SLR system, some medium format and such, they are really not getting a taste of the hobby.   You also don't get to see what is so special about that expensive camera without first shooting other stuff.    
  
I guess the Leica can always be used next to the other cameras as you expand your experience, but it isn't as fun since the other stuff may not have the same pop.  I would say no reason to envy, just enjoy using what you have and build up into your gear you want to use.",1,1724898964.0,2024-08-29 02:36:04,,0,1f3jie7

lkgc0oo,Ready_Blueberry_6836,"There are so many variables and even other lenses to consider that comparing these two is hard.  Get the lens that you think will inspire and excite you to shoot more.   I did recently buy a 28mm lens and decided on the v4 Elmarit.   

I don't own the Ultron, so I can just go off of hearsay and reviews.    It seems nice.  Stating the obvious, the advantages of the Ultron over the Elmarit are 1) a smaller size, 2) being able to shoot at F2, and 3) a cheaper price even buying new.

I personally went for the Elmarit over other 28mm lenses.  The v3 also looked lovely, but I didn't get the v3 because I preferred a newer, made in Germany lens.  I liked the small size of the Elmarit 28 asph, but it was be a bit out of my budget.  I also read many reviews and looked at images and the Elmarit v4 (as well as v3) seemed to have a magic about their pictures.   28mm is also not my first choice in focal length, so I didn't want to spend more than the price of the v4.   
  
Now in hindsight I can say the Elmarit 28 v4 is pretty perfect for me.  It's photos are magical though I only shoot film so I don't know digital wise.  It is extremely sharp, but also the bokeh and micro contrast where it goes into the bokeh are dreamy and beautiful.   The lens is not super tiny, but it isn't big or heavy.   The lens tab is so smooth and buttery and makes focusing really nice.  It looks very nice on a Leica film camera.   Overall, I would recommend it.

The thing is, I really like Leica rendering.  I shot the Rokkor 40 first with a CLE like 20 years ago, and the images always blew me away.  I think it converted me way back then.  The micro-contrast and sharpness of that lens was very Leica.   Anyway, recently, when I did decide to get some new glass for my Leica; I sold some of my other cameras and splurged on Leica glass.  I do not regret it at all.     
  
I wanted a 28 and the Elmarit version 4 which I got is pretty amazing.   I did lots of research and it seems to hit that sweet spot as far as rendering.  I can definitely see why people believe that.  It is sharp, but has somewhat of a soft dreamy feel to it as well.  It doesn't blow out the contrast and so the way it renders colors and black and white are both special.   I also love the focus tab and feel of it. 

I am addicted to the Elmarit and the other lens I bought recently...  the Lux 35 aspherical pre fle.  Seeing the way they render on film is just absolutely stunning.

I wonder how long that ISOOZ adapter has been sitting on the lens? On a modern Leica M this one will bring up the wrong framelines, 35 and 135, but it was the recommended adapter for mounting this lens on an M2, before 28mm framelines had been invented (you'll just see the 35mm framelines). None of this matters on mirrorless, of course, where there are no framelines to worry about (and you might not need it at all if you have an LTM to mirrorless rather than an M to mirrorless adapter).",1,1724858052.0,2024-08-28 15:14:12,,0,1f2xdh5

lk86dyf,HorkusSnorkus,"50mm Leica lenses are all over the place in how they behave.  I've have/had four of them:

\* Uncoated 50mm f/3.5 Elmar LTM - It's tack sharp but lacks the contrast of the newer optics.  BUT ... its lack of coating gives it marvelous ghosting effects when shooting into specular highlights and other bright light sources.  That's why I keep it around.

\* Mid 1950s Collapsible LTM Summicron 50mm f/2.  I had a love/hate relationship with this lens.  When it was good, it was amazing, but when pushed to the limits, it wasn't remotely sharp or contrasty enough for what I wanted.  When people talk about ""the classic Leica look"" what they mean is low contrast, I think.

\* A V3 Summicron 50mm f/2 M mount.  That's my goto these days.  In theory, the V4/5 like you have is ""better"" but I don't see how.  That V3 is superb.  The improvement of the newer versions might be more visible on a color digital system like an M11 if you were, say, to pixel peep.  But knowing how much I like mine, I suspect you will be veeeeerrrrrrry happy with yours.

\* A 50mm f/2.5 Voigtlander Color-Skopar LTM.  This lens will make you cry.  Why?  Because at least on monochrome film, I cannot discern any significant difference in performance between that and the Summicron, and the Voigtlander is 1/4 the cost, that's why ;)  But, I mostly got it to use with  a IIIf since Leica made few modern lenses for the LTM mount.

lk99qmx,HorkusSnorkus,"I would never buy an M6 over an M5  (well, ""never"" is a long time),  though I might buy them both ;)

I would buy a very clean late serial number M5 and then have DAG do a full CLA.  You will end up with an amazing camera (assuming it was good in the first place).

In fairness, the human interface to the M5 is different than any other M body.  I also own an M2 and an M4 which are more 'pure' M experiences as is the M6 ... which is why the M5 was initially disliked.  It is slightly larger than a traditional M body like the M6 and it just ... feels different a little bit.

But some things on the M5 are just better.  Notably, shutter speed selection is really great on that body.

For the record, I do go through cognitive shift when I move from an M2 to an M4, but it is quite small. Moving from either of them to the M5 is much more noticeable.

The one thing you'll give up with an M5 is 28mm frame lines.

To be clear, there is nothing wrong with an M6, but they are pretty pricey and - 28mm framelines aside - do nothing the M5 won't.

P.S. Purists and collectors insist that the only ""real"" Leicas where up to and including the M5.  Anything made thereafter - they claim - is built with more standard parts, more plastic, and less custom fitting.  While that may be true, I've heard no evidence that the M4-P, M4-II,  M-6, and M-A are unreliable.

lk4159l,sp3ct0r1640,"Get the M5!
I fucking love mine. I have traveled a bunch with it. It takes great photos - I have both modern and vintage glass. The meter is fantastic but ensure you get one that works correctly. It is a spot meter so know that you want that if your getting an M5. 

Here are the downsides from an M5 user.

Grip accessories do not fit. You just have to hold it. 
In fact many ‚ÄúM‚Äù accessories don‚Äôt fit.

When the meter goes it‚Äôs all over. You‚Äôre not likely to get it fixed - Leica won‚Äôt touch it and there are essentially no parts. 

Unless it‚Äôs had some work done you need a MR-9 converter or zinc batteries. Neither is that hard to get. 

It‚Äôs not the easiest to get serviced but there are people who will work on it.

The 2 lug model can only be carried one way and it‚Äôs annoying.

You can‚Äôt use some older lenses because they stick in too far and could damage the light meter. 

The POSITIVES.

It‚Äôs a Leica for less money. Spend more on film and maybe a tad more to get a nicer lens.
It‚Äôs got a great viewfinder.
It‚Äôs got a great shutter speed dial - far better than other Leicas. 
It‚Äôs fantastic for people with bigger hands.
It has quick load.
The freaking self timer - I have used it often.
The rewind knob is in the correct place and easy to use and has a clutch so it won‚Äôt spin backwards.

llivnjr,AltruisticCover3005,"Go for it. I did own an M2, an M3 (with 0.85x finder) and an M6 about 10-12 years ago and sold all of them about 8 years ago. I mostly use Nikon SLRs. But I did miss the rangefinder, so now I own a black M5.

I bought it in August 2023 from a camera store in Germany, freshly maintained by Dimas Fototechnik, who is a respectable company as far as I know. The machines was CLAed, adjusted to modern 1.55 V batteries, came with an adapter ring so that the batteries fit properly and it works like a charm. It looks of course used, a tiny dent in the top plate and the originally black coating has turned a bit greyish.

But the camera works perfectly and I consider its ergonomics to be much better than that of an M6 (which I did own 10 years ago).

1. I can read the shutter speed in the rangefinder
2. The meter is a very tight spot and the lines in the RF will show you where the spot is. I love spot metering
3. the needle shows you not only if you are good, it actually shows you how far off you are. this combined with the spot metering makes metering for the shadows much easier; take a bit of time and you‚Äòll know how far off you are without going to correct esposure and then stop down again.
4. the shutter wheel is so big that you can operate it with the index finger while looking through the finder.

In total it is an incredibly well designed camera. If you want to actually shoot film with your M, you cannot really go better.

Even if they were available at the same price, I would probably take the M5 instead of the M6. I do consider it so much better. 

And while I agree that it is the ugliest M camera, that does not mean much considering that Ms are among the prettiest cameras. The M5 still is a quite pretty camera. Who would call a pretty woman ugly, just because after looking through the internet for hours you could point at another woman, that is a tiny bit prettier? That IMHO is what M5 haters mostly do.

And the price? 990 EUR, at that time roughly 1050 USD. It would have been almost impossible to get an objectively worse M4-P for that price.",2,1725482002.0,2024-09-04 20:33:22,,0,1f2537k

One thing that puzzles me is that Kolari, who have been offering their own cover glass replacement for a while, now seem to have obtained a stock of complete factory sensors with Leica's new glass already fitted, which can be installed at additional cost. Where did they get them from? Did they do a deal with the factory who were supplying Leica, or did Leica themselves sell their remaining sensors to Kolari?

lk614b2,SuperbWillingness260,"I have an M11M and here are my thoughts/experiences:

If you‚Äôre a black and white shooter, you‚Äôll love it. I love the raw files that it produces and it‚Äôs so fun editing them. I actually disagree with people who say that you can convert color files and get the same if not better results. I personally can tell the difference between those and mono images, and very much prefer the later. On the other hand, I‚Äôve always struggled to edit color photos because I always feel like I overdo it. Black and white feels natural. 

Photography with the monochrom is liberating. I‚Äôm leaving a few days of shooting in Chicago, and brought with me my M11M as well as my SL2-S for when I wanted to shoot color. I lugged both around with me for the first two days, and left the SL in the room for the rest of the trip. I found myself stressing out over whether a photo would look better in mono or color. I got tired of that and just decided to only shoot mono. Once I did that, I was free to think about the photographs that would be best in mono rather that vice versa. My best photos came after that. Thinking about what you can‚Äôt take photos of is, I think, the wrong way to think about it. Rather, it opens up a new style of photography and subject matter. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get rid of my monochrom. With that said, unless you are 100% committed to B&W, I would recommend having a backup in case there are occasions that you might want to shoot color. For me, this is why I got the SL2-S with the benefit that I could use my M glass on it. Even then however, the more I commit to monochrom the less the SL gets picked up. Fully committing to mono photography is pretty challenging and has taken me a year to get to this point, but it has taught me that color photography isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm good at, and that‚Äôs okay. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs a matter of personal preference and your use case. Is it an expensive means of photographing family? I might not recommend mono. If it‚Äôs a creative outlet and a means of artistic expression? It can be one of the best experiences.",10,1724762921.0,2024-08-27 12:48:41,,0,1f2e2xb

There were two primary reasons I decided to return it. First, I‚Äôm not exclusively a B&W photographer, and it was just too limiting. Some photos demand color.

Also, since the green is a lighter color, wear is slightly more noticeable there as well compared to the black. On the regular Q2, I would say the wear looks like different dull textures of black overtime. Chips on either camera show up about the same. That being said, I would say the wear isn‚Äôt pronounced or highly noticeable on either camera overall. It‚Äôs only particularly noticeable up close.

lk50h12,SpacemonkeySTI," Another vote for archetype process. Using profiles is a lot easier than buying presets. Think of it like this. Lightroom interprets your raw file a certain way. When you‚Äôre in develop module, if you look above the exposure slider, you‚Äôll see a profile and that profile defaults to adobe color. This is adobe‚Äôs interpretation of what that color should be of the raw file. For people that love capture one, they love the way capture one interprets the raw file over adobe. That starting base is important.

All of the presets out there adjust HSL while leaving the exposure, contrast, highlight, shadow, white, black sliders alone.  Easy to create your own presets and sell. Much more difficult to create a profile to interpret raw files.

What the archetype process sells are color profiles to interpret your raw files to emulate film and the appropriate scanner you enjoy.

For  Example:
portra 400Normal development scanned on a frontier
Or
portra 400 pushed 1 scanned on noritsu.
They have all kinds of film emulations. And no sliders are adjusted. Basic sliders and HSL. You still have the ability to make your own adjustments. You‚Äôre simply unlocking new ways to interpret color off the raw files.

You can make your own presets based off of which profiles you enjoy using!",1,1724742223.0,2024-08-27 07:03:43,,0,1f22sd2

lk3ox1a,AnonymousBromosapien,"I think the common misunderstanding a lot of people have is that they equate a LR or C1 preset to operating in the same manner as what happens when you use something like the Fujifilm film sims in-camera. The reality is, these two processes arent anywhere near the same. 

A preset, as im sure you are aware, is just a saved group of arbitrary slider adjustments in LR or C1. The issue with these is... its impossible for them to generate the same putcome on varying images because different color hues, levels of saturation, lighting, potentially white balance differences, contrast, etc all often differ from image to image... sometimes even differing in images taken in the same location not to long after one another. This means that the *""preset slider adjustments""* that are *""presets""* wont translate the same from image to image.

This is vastly different than what something like a fujifilm film sim does in-camera because that camera itself uses algorithms and the data that it receives from a scene to make similar adjustments from shot to shot and scene to scene in an effort to give the film sim their consistent and unique look.

A preset in LR or C1 can in no way do the same thing just by simply applying it to an image. Meaning they are effectively pointless because you have to treat every image independently to get a consistent polish/look.

Yes, presets can be effective in your workflow for similar shots with similar lighting/color/contrast/etc. I.e. if you did a studio shoot... a preset would speed up workflow in that it would apply the same to all the images from that session given that the scene/lighting/colors/etc remained the same from frame to frame. However, these *""preset packages""* where the presented shots are all dolled up and looks *""super cool!""* is just advertising... and youll likely never get the same outcome from those presets. They are tailored for the images they are presented on and wont look the same on whatever image you apply them to.

People downvoting me and being upset is fine, and im sure more will come. But the reality is there is nothing special about anyone else's preset pack that you cant create yourself for free. And even if you do, youll still find yourself in the same situation you are now in realizing that a preset created on one image doesnt translate to other images as flawlessly and youd want. As others have said here... *""I use presets, but I still have to treat each shot individually""*. Ive been a photographer for decades, and this whole preset madness is only a recent trend... nobody needs to buy someone elses preset package lol.

Circling around to my first point... preset packs are just snake oil... bottled up in a pretty package and made to trick you into thinking you can get the same effect with the click of a button if you buy it.",3,1724719319.0,2024-08-27 00:41:59,,0,1f22sd2

lk3qytb,AideChoice3813,"What a great reply! This got me thinking, what‚Äôs your take on profiles then? RNI makes a bold claim with their Film Pro 5 emulator, saying that because their edits are profile-based they offer ""better"" color accuracy and uniformity. The color uniformity part makes sense since they‚Äôre replacing the profile, but how could that improve color more than a regular preset? It doesn‚Äôt quite add up, but maybe there‚Äôs something to it. If you‚Äôve got any insights, I‚Äôm all ears. Otherwise, your last reply was spot-on!",1,1724720096.0,2024-08-27 00:54:56,,0,1f22sd2
lk3wtux,AnonymousBromosapien,">The color uniformity part makes sense since they‚Äôre replacing the profile, but how could that improve color more than a regular preset?

So what ICC Profiles do is basically *""color correct""* the imported RAW data contained in the imported RAW file so that the image presented to you in LR or C1 matches the way that your camera processes that data. This might take some explaining lol.

Because RAW files are not image files... when you capture RAW data with your camera, the camera presents you a *""preview""* of that RAW data as an image. How each camera processes that RAW data to present it in its own *""profile""*. When you import a RAW file into LR or C1 it has to process that data as well to be able to present an image so that you can see how your edits impact that data. 

Because LR and C1 have their own native way of processing that RAW data, the profiles on LR and C1, as I said above, are used to change the way the RAW data is processed so that it will be presented in the same way your camera would process it. This way the processed RAW data you see on your computer monitor looks more like the image presented to you on the rear LCD screen of the canera that captured it.

Im not sure about LR because I have used it in years, but C1 already sets this ICC profile to the appropriate camera when you import the images... so you dont even have to do anything regarding profiles.

Most ICC profiles are differ very slightly when it comes to how they process RAW data, and they are readily available on LR and C1 for free. However, it seems the aim of those like the ones from RNI is to recreate film stock as an ICC profile... which is interesting... But how accurate those are to the claimed film stock they aim to emulate is sort of just *""trust me bro""*. Additionally, there are limitatioms that you are going to want to look into.

Are they better than presets? It depends... they also arent just some one click and boom everything looks great solution either. Youll still have to get into the sliders and make adjustments and treat each shot individually. So yea... the promises they make with ICC Profiles is still snake oil-esque.

The reality is, the only way you are getting a consistent look across multiple images outside of hitting the LR/C1 sliders is if that adjustment process is happening in-camera when the image is processed and a JPEG produced. Other than that... you are hitting the sliders no matter what you try to slap on a LR/C1 import. Im sure one day and AI post processing software will come about that will have the effect the preset market is looking for... but as of right now I dont think that exists.",3,1724722361.0,2024-08-27 01:32:41,,0,1f22sd2

If it needs to work off a hot shoe, then you can get a hot shoe that mounts to your cold shoe which connects for PC sync port to your camera.

With bad agitation technique, you can get uneven development that looks exactly like this: lighter areas at the top and bottom of frame, with a darker strip through the middle. It‚Äôs very common with stand development in my experience.

I've had both: moving too slowly or not fully inverting can cause uneven development (a bit like this, in fact) where the developer gets ""stuck"" in the reel, and inverting too violently can cause streaks as the developer rushes through/past the sprocket holes.

What I tend to do now - especially with Rodinal, which seems to be more fussy than HC-110 and its clones - is a smooth inversion while also rotating the tank in the process. The first two inversions each minute rotate clockwise, the second two rotate anti-clockwise.

lk2o1y2,huff65535,"I have SL2S, M10R Black Paint and M10M Leitz edition.  I mostly use my M‚Äôs however:

1. When doing portraits with 90 M APO wide open, I find my hit rate focusing the SL higher than the M even with EVF.  

2.  The low light capability w/o noise the SL2S wins hands down every day. 

3.  If less stable, I do enjoy the stabilization on the SL, even though there a tradeoff of perfect lens performance when using stabilization on any camera. 

4.  If I need to run and gun for pets, kids, sports, etc.  That‚Äôs why I have 1 SL35 APO which is stellar for this. 

5.  The video quality is about as close to ARRI Alexa or RED as you can get and the pixels for color grading are simply outstanding. 

6.  Giving my SL with AF lens to a friend or family when around house or at gathering is way easier of course than M system (especially if I‚Äôd like to be in a photo sometimes lol üòÇ)

7.  And as have others posted ‚Ä¶with SL lenses, it‚Äôs easily ready for the rain or other harsh conditions vs. M which the body is only dust & splash resistant.

Last, and üíØ agree, there is learning curve between M & SL for sure.  When I switch, between M and SL2S I spent time configuring my profiles to as closely match my M I‚Äôm used to.  It‚Äôs not perfect, but for me customizing the Wheels + FN buttons is the best quick fix to get you ‚Äòclose‚Äô.  But if don‚Äôt use your SL for a while the muscle memory on your customizations may drop from memory.

lk063zm,vxxn,"Seems like you already know what you should do. Some of the things that are bugging you, especially size, will not improve with time. If you are a successful M shooter, I don‚Äôt see why you would have a need for an AF system covering the normal range. If you‚Äôre just looking for a bit of AF convenience in some situations, maybe a Q-series is what you need.

Some use cases I see for big DSLR-style mirrorless camera are specialty stuff like:

- macro photography where parallax issues seem like a dealbreaker for the rangefinder model
- you want big telephotos for sports/wildlife (>> 135mm) where you need a magnified view to compose
- you‚Äôre often in extreme environments where weather sealing is a must
- you have times when you need to shoot one-handed or have an AF camera you can hand off to someone else.
- You need to shoot very wide apertures in low light / fast paced environments where your rangefinder speed/ hit rate might be insufficient. I‚Äôm thinking commercial wedding photography.

But if these apply, the bang for buck is much greater in other systems. 

I have a Nikon Z8 which makes lovely images but also suffers from the size problem; besides being cumbersome to drag around, a camera this size for family/travel use has the impact of altering the scene. People see a huge camera instead of your face. And you are experiencing important moments in life through a tiny TV screen (EVF) instead of with your own two eyes.

For me at least, big camera also seems to give everyone around me the impression that I am acting as an event photographer and they think they are entitled to my images. Nobody has ever asked me for my cell phone snaps, but they seem to have no hesitation to ask for my big camera pictures. It has the effect of turning me into that, because I feel more pressure to get the images that others will want instead of just what I want. Plus the labor on the backend to do the editing and sharing. It‚Äôs deep into the realm of first world problems, but it does diminish my photography experience having to contend with expectations from others.",2,1724676020.0,2024-08-26 12:40:20,,0,1f1krsw

I've decided to keep the SL2-S a little longer, but to try out some different lenses. When I look back over the pictures I've taken with the camera so far, the ones I've made with my M lenses really speak to me, and the ones I've taken with my Sigmas (24-70 and 45 f/2.8) mostly don't. So I may sell those lenses and try the 24-90 or an APO Summicron, or just keep the camera to use with M lenses longer than 50mm.

I also played around with the settings more, and I think I came to grips with the camera a little better; in particular, I set things up so I can more easily use back button and manual focus on my autofocus lenses. This made me feel like I had more control over the focusing behavior. It still feels less intuitive than I'd like, but I'm going to stick with it for a bit longer.

Once you get used to the direction the focusing works, you probably won't accidentally turn it under 0,7m. With a 35mm you'll probably set the focus of the lens to whatever feels right for your style of photography, like 2m or 3m and just focus with your feet.

As for actually using the close focusing distance if you want, you've got some options. If you want to use the full close focus scale... realistically a tripod and measuring tape. If you want to be more spontaneous, you've got to work out a ""focusing aid"" for one specific focus distance. For example you can see how long your camera strap is when pulled taut forward, and there is your focus distance. Point the strap at flower or whatever object you want to be sharp, drop the strap and push shutter button. Or you can see how long a distance your fingers are from your elbow and use that. Say it's 50cm for your arm. Finger touches object and camera goes into the pit of the elbow. Turn focus to 50cm and you're bang on. But it will be impossible to use this wide open, even one centimeter of movement and you're out of focus at these distances.

lk3pefz,Arrileica,"I had that happen before. 

The reason that scam ‚Äúworks‚Äù is because PayPal only see that the item was delivered and delivered in your zip code. You file a claim saying you never received it , PayPal just parrots the public info on usps‚Äô site says and denies your case. The only info that usps gives is that the item was delivered and the zip code which I guess triggers something in the PayPal system as a valid delivery. 

I called PayPal, they told me to call usps and have them confirm where it was delivered. I then had to call usps , they couldn‚Äôt tell me where it was delivered. I asked if it was delivered to my address , they could confirm it wasn‚Äôt. I asked if they could give me that in Writing , they said no. They instructed me to call PayPal and have them submit a claim. PayPal should have just done that in the first place but admire their ability to take the highest fees possibly while offering the worst customer service. 

I got my money back. 

It‚Äôs just a waste of time. I assume they think people will just take the loss or not do the leg work ? Also if you chat PayPal and not call, it‚Äôs a frustrating circle that ends with them repeating it was delivered and they aren‚Äôt responsible for porch thefts. My item was 45 bucks tho not 750.

Scrubbed the extra dot with nail polish remover (without acetone), Q-tips and an old toothbrush. The adhesive on the back wasn‚Äôt usable after that though. Then I put a few layers of black spray paint on it. There is some texture to it, which I actually like a lot.

When all was set and dry, I polished the embossed Leica logo with a little more of the nail polish remover and Q-tips.

Putting it back in place was a headscratcher at first, because all adhesive dots I could find, were simply too thick. In the end I just put a strip of basic double sided tape on the camera and used the round inlet to cut the tape with a scalpel and then put the new black leica dot in place.

Fingers crossed, it‚Äôll stay in place.

I also changed the little red dot on the lens release button to black, to match everything better. I used nail polish remover there too, but would advise to be very careful, to not harm the little plastic rail around it. 

There are still some modifications on the wish list. Kamerakraft grip is already ordered. I am debating on putting an MP lever and some ostrich leatherette on it.",3,1724612613.0,2024-08-25 19:03:33,,0,1f11vh5

ljvinqr,GammaDeltaTheta,"Yes, it's a real IIIc.

Don't know about the body covering, which looks a bit ragged around the edges - replacement?

The fakes are based on Soviet FED and Zorki copies of the Leica II and are generally easy to spot. You won't see features like the adjacent RF and VF eyepieces, or the slow speed dial, or the extension of the top plate down towards the lens mount, or the eyepiece adjustment lever under the rewind knob, or the circular RF cam follower etc. that this one has. See:

http://rick\_oleson.tripod.com/index-213.html

There are other things to consider if you want to use it. Unless this camera has been overhauled recently, it probably needs a service nearly 80 years after it was made. It's common for the RF second image to become faint (that red filter may have been fitted to improve the contrast) and for the shutter speeds to become erratic, etc.",5,1724602169.0,2024-08-25 16:09:29,,0,1f0zagz

Personally to me the Dlux8 is a rehash of the aged DLux7 guts but it is a decent starter camera with a useful zoom range in a small portable size. My two cents is actually the Dlux8 kinda made the DLux7 even more attractive now that latter is cheaper. 

IQ wise the Q2 is going to be way ahead of the Dlux8, in almost every aspect, while the Q3 is likely overall for most people with its triple resolution sensor and I‚Äôll only go for that if budget is no biggie plus I really want the fastest and most modern iteration.

If the dlux8 is more suited to your use case, definitely look at other point and shoots out there. The Sony RX100 series has a bigger sensor and second hand will be a fraction of the price of the Leica. The dlux8 is nice, but very poor value for money imo. The older Q‚Äôs are better value than the new Q3 but they‚Äôre still not cheap, but all Q‚Äôs share the same awesome lens which imo is the main reason to get it.

I just can't decide what would best fit  my needs vs desires as a photography enthusiast.   I like the simplicity of the Leica system from what i've been able to put together via YouTube. 

  
I mostly lean towards the Q2 because of summilux lens, and full sensor size, while the d-Lux8 has only a micro four third sensor which does feel like a step backwards. 

But then on other days I remember I've barely begun my photography journey and might be more then happy with the lesser d-Lux8 taking fully advantage of the simplicity of the Leica system and not at all bother by the 17MP photographs.  

I don't know. I'm still researching and eventually I'll make a decision. OR I'll see one of them in store and bite the bullet and live with that decision. Post a follow up when you purchase.",0,1724647643.0,2024-08-26 04:47:23,,0,1f1csor
ljyxz6j,sugar_hobson,"I am considering selling my Q2 and buying the Dlux8. My reasons to downsize goes like this: PRO- 1. the simplicity of the menu system is my favorite feature, and they both have it, 2. I prize the smallest cameras, 3. 45 MPs needlessly uses up hard drive space, 4. Newer-ish tech. CONS- 1. Weather sealing, 2. Losing the summilux, 3. 45 MPs is too much, but 16 MPs leave no room at all for reframing, 4.

ljrf7qa,dhyratoro,"Here is the writing from my Oscar Wilde AI:

Ah, the Leica photographer‚Äîa rare breed indeed, whose devotion to their craft is matched only by their devotion to their camera. One must admire their unwavering belief that a Leica, much like the philosopher‚Äôs stone, can transform the mundane into the extraordinary. Yet, it seems the true magic lies not in the camera itself, but in the wallet, which becomes significantly lighter with each purchase.

These photographers, armed with their Leicas, embark on a noble quest to capture the essence of life, often mistaking the price tag for talent. They roam the streets, their cameras slung around their necks like a badge of honor, ready to capture the decisive moment‚Äîor at least, the moment they decide is worthy of their Leica‚Äôs attention. For them, every click of the shutter is not just a photograph, but a statement, a declaration of their superior taste and discernment.

But let us not be too harsh. After all, it takes a certain courage to wield a camera that costs as much as a small car, especially when the resulting images are often indistinguishable from those taken with a device that fits comfortably in one‚Äôs pocket. Perhaps the true art lies in convincing oneself‚Äîand others‚Äîthat the Leica‚Äôs mystique is worth the price of admission.

In the end, the Leica photographer is a testament to the power of belief. They believe in their camera, in their vision, and most importantly, in the notion that art is not about the tools one uses, but about the story one tells. And if that story happens to include a Leica, well, who are we to argue with art?",3,1724532958.0,2024-08-24 20:55:58,,0,1ezy5b8
