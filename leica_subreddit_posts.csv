40vyl9,Posting Guidelines for Imagery/Photography,"For those who are new to the subreddit, or may not be aware, please know that /r/Leica is a subreddit focused on sharing content specifically pertaining to Leica Camera. For this reason, in order for an image to be shared, it would need to fit into one of the following categories:

•The content of the image would need to be focused on Leica Camera products.

•If the content does not focus specifically on Leica Camera products the image must have been taken with a Leica camera, and demonstrates a skill or technique that is incredibly difficult to execute correctly, has not been seen before, or both.

It is important to know that being able to focus, frame a shot, play with depth of field, and other rudimentary techniques, are not considered particularly difficult or unseen. These are the bare minimum requirements for taking a photo with any camera, especially a Leica. If you would like to share images taken with a Leica camera that does not meet one of the two criterias listed above please refer to the side bar for a list of subreddits that welcome this type of content.

Yes, this means that post frequency will be significantly lower than in other subreddits. Yes, this means that there will be significantly less user engagement. This is absolutely fine. The tradeoff is that we have a unique community where visitors are able to get information and content specific to Leica Camera, without having to filter through a swarm of image based posts. Short of forums and a handful of blogs (most of which are sponsored) this makes /r/Leica a unique community, and a useful resource for fans of Leica cameras.",103,0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/40vyl9/posting_guidelines_for_imageryphotography/,SnowHawkMike,1452744726,1/14/16 4:12,0,,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0
1f2y7wq,What I'd like you to know about flair-- Please check it out if you care about flair,"Most of my time is spent answering questions about flair.

This is not where I'd like to spend it. I'd prefer to spend it on the beach taking pictures of my M6 with my other M6's, but alas- I am not a dentist.

So- most of the problems are because you're using the official mobile app, or some other app, or the mobile website. The problem is that the functionality varies between desktop website, mobile website, and any random app.

So-- if you have flair trouble- please make sure you're not overlooking something, and then also try on the desktop website.

If you're still having trouble, r/help is a good place to ask. If they tell you that only a mod can help you, then let me know.

**UPDATE to existing flair** 
It appears that only the M10 flair allowed you to edit it. In my case, I'd selected it, then wiped what was there and added all the stuff.

Going forward, the better way to handle ""How do I get all my cameras into the flair"" is to select the **""TYPE YOUR OWN  FLAIR""** and then wipe the text, put in whatever you want.

1g42bgi,Advice needed! Leica M2 purchase for boyfriend?,"Hi everyone,

I need some advice!
I’m purchasing my boyfriend a camera for his birthday, and I came across this Leica M2. He doesn’t have a Leica in his collection yet, and he’s mentioned wanting one, so I got quite excited when I saw it. 

It’s quite far away from me, so I can’t test if it’s working. The seller doesn’t know cameras so can’t tell me either. From the photos, it seems like it’s sat on a shelf for a while. 

The camera comes with a lens and light meter. It’s for $180 (I’m in South Africa, so this is the converted amount). Based on what I’ve seen online, it seems like a steal? Even if it needs a service? 

It also comes with a cool book!

1g41l6f,Debris/filthy film gate M2 ,"Hi folks,

This shows up in all my negatives. It doesn’t bother me too much but if there is an easy solution that doesn’t mean I have to be without this extension of my hand for months while it’s in the shop, I would love to know. 

The triangular incursions at the top left and right (cropped) of the frames are particularly annoying as they stick out like dogs balls against sky and eat into my usable image. The uneven bordering on the vertical  (particularly top left) also gives me the shits when I want to crop for film boarders. 

I am wondering if this is something that can be cleaned while in bulb with say a sensor swab and an appropriate solvent or is something more sinister happening here? If I were to do that would I proceed as gingerly as one would clean a sensor or a mirror? I tried air but that didn’t do much for the issue. 

This is definitely a users camera and I purchased it as such, it had a very hard life before it got to me and I and I’m carrying on the tradition of treating it with respect but also, like actual camera gear. 

Everything else functions beautifully, slow and high speeds are nearly bang on, checked with audio, I’ve had it 6 months and now and I can’t imagine life without my hunk of brass bracelet.

I'm fine with buying second handed old Ms because I'll feel more responsible for the general sustainable market. Here's my fav reasons between M2 and M4 (also reasons not to get em)

- rewind knob feels more substantial 
- i enjoy models that doesn't have the timer
- worry about smaller eye relief 
- worry about if i don't like the slow loading

1g3pt2n,Q2 or D-Lux 8? (First Leica),"I’ve been shooting for a decade now but photography is definitely just a hobby. I love taking pictures while traveling, hiking, street photography, etc. I’ve slimmed down my cameras in recent years and am now looking to get a Leica.

I currently have a Sony A7iii (27-70mm) and a Nikon F3 (50mm). Plus a few lenses that are just okay. 

I was set to get the D-Lux 8 because of its size and versatility. I feel like it’s the kind of camera I would take everywhere that I put in my sling bag or pocket. I like that the file sizes are small thus an easy post workflow for posting on social media. 

Since I’ve been waiting for the D-Lux for a few months I came across a Q2 that a friend is selling at a very good price. I’ve always loved the Q cameras from afar. Obviously the picture quality is above and beyond the D-Lux. Even though it’s not quite as versatile, I like the idea of getting this camera at a deal and selling my Sony. (I honestly haven’t used my Sony much anymore because I find it way too bulky). Do you think a Q2 would be enough to replace my Sony given its fixed focal length?

I understand the Q2 and D-Lux are completely different cameras but still want to know your opinions given my situation.

TLDR: Get a D-Lux to add to my arsenal (Sony A7iii, Nikon F3) or get a Q2 to replace my Sony?

I'm a student and broke. Photography is not my profession, but it is my passion (at least 6 years).
 
I firstly fell in love with the canon l3. Since, I upgraded to the m2 and I will use it until it cannot be repaired anymore.

I would like to get a digital m, something that will be an everyday carry. Currently, that is the m2 but I cannot keep up with the film prices.

I thought I'd share my own thoughts on it, so I can have something to look back on when I feel the urge to upgrade again.

I've owned plenty of 35mm lenses across systems, including the Zeiss M f/2 twice, but this Summarit is a gem. It's not quite as sharp as the Zeiss, but subjectively I prefer its rendering. It's smaller, much nicer to handle, and doesn't have that annoying wobble that 5 of my 9 Zeiss lenses developed (and even my 50mm Summilux ASPH, though that was an easy fix at home once I bent a jewellers screwdriver for access).

I haven't tried the other Summarit focal lengths, but if they're as good as the 35, I could see myself shooting an entire kit of them.

This bar makes it difficult to see the bottom part of the frame when I shoot? (Anybody have problems with this or am I the only one? I come from shooting with a Ricoh GR3x and I can turn off the exposure settings display.) 

2) Separating AFL/Autofocus Lock from Shutter Button:  
Is there any way to separate the AFL/auto-focus from the shutter button? I'm looking for a way to lock the focus so it doesn't refocus every time I take a shot--particularly when shooting portraits.   
(On my Ricoh, I can set the Fn button to AFL/AEL, so the shutter button only triggers the shutter, not the  focus. Any way to do this on the Q3?) 

3) Removing the Autofocus Point Box:  
Is there any way to have the green autofocus point box go away?   
(On my Ricoh, there's an option to set it so that after it focuses, the box goes away. The autofocus box obstructs my view of the subject's face when I shoot. Quite inconvenient.) 

I asked my local Leica store clerk and he says the above functions are not available on the Q3. Hard to find information on these issues online too. Would love to hear any tips/workarounds.

1g33yj8,"Leica M10 ""No Card Available"" Issue – Need Help! ","Hey everyone,

I'm having a bit of a problem with my Leica M10, and I'm hoping someone here might have some advice. Recently, my camera started showing the message ""No Card Available"" whenever I try to use it. I've already tried multiple SD cards of different brands and capacities, but nothing seems to work.

Here's what I've done so far:

Checked that all the cards are compatible with the Leica M10.

Formatted the cards both on my computer and directly in the camera.

Inspected and cleaned the card slot to make sure there’s no dust or debris.

Reset the camera to its factory settings.

Made sure the firmware is up to date.


Still, the issue persists. 😞

If it turns out to be a hardware problem with the card reader, does anyone have any DIY solutions for fixing it without sending it in for repair? I’m trying to avoid the hassle and cost of sending it to a service center if possible.

Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

So I currently have a Voigtlander Ultron 35mm f2 ii and am considering swapping it for the Nokton Classic 35mm f1.4 ii.
But I'm struggling to find a good comparison between the 2 lenses on film, not digital. Every review I've seen of the Nokton has been on digital, and focuses on the performance wide open which doesn't help me as I basically never shoot lower than 5.6 (Sunny 16, 95% daylight shooting on an M4P, no portraiture).
I really love the Ultron's rendering and sharpness at smaller apertures, also its minimal distortion and vignetting. But.... I do want something with a bit more vintage rendering and ""glow"" around the highlights. However not if that means strong vignetting, distortion and corner softness even at f8. 
Anyone have any images they can share of the Nokton on film, and not wide open? Or suggestions to share? If the 2 lenses are basically indistinguishable under these conditions then I'll happily stay with the Ultron.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/1g35jfa/voigtlander_35mm_nokton_classic_vs_ultron/,nick_cal94,1728871146,10/14/24 1:59,1,,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0

After mithering for months, I finally found a (very lightly used)  M11M at a price I couldn't pass up.  So I'm now the proud owner of a M11 Monochrom.  Never thought I'd say that.  I'm very happy with it, and I know it will bring me a lot of enjoyment.

However, for me it's a big purchase, and I want to make sure I'm checking everything I should, so help is appreciated.  For now I'm using with my 1st gen aspherical 'cron, and potentially some Voigtlanders.

1) I've taken some photos of a blue sky to check for sensor bifurcation, and I can't see any yet (I know that was an occasional issue on the M10M)

2) There's one or two dust spots when stopped down, which are obviously easily removed digitally.  Besides the price, is there any reason a Leica (or the mono in particular) is more scary to sensor clean?  I doubt I will, but for future reference.

3) Haven't seen any hot/dead pixels yet, nor any hot or dead LEDs in the screen.

4) Rangefinder looks well aligned and accurate.  At least as accurate as my M4-P

5) Battery seems decent enough.  It's on charge again now.

Anything else I should be checking for before the 14 day return window closes?

1g0maup,Why are Leica Q’s so cheap?,"A bit of a clickbait title but was thinking about this earlier. Shouldn’t Q’s be way more expensive than M’s? 

I’m saying this as a Q2 owner who is really intrigued by an M, but having a hard time wrapping my head around the prices! Just looking at brand new prices from B&H:

- Q3: $6400

- Q343: $6900

- MP: $6000

- M11: $9000

- Summicron 28mm f2: $5400

- Summicron 50mm f2 APO: $9300


I’m not an engineer so please correct me but I would imagine the electronics and autofocus system on the Q’s would be more expensive than the counterparts on an M, although I could be wrong. Autofocus seems like it would be more reliable than the rangefinder system (edit: in terms of focus accuracy, maybe not longevity) and I would think be a premium. 

So what am I missing? Is Leica losing money on Q’s? Does Leica think lens interchangeability is worth a relatively large premium? Is it the rangefinder system/experience?

I recently purchased a Leica Elmarit-M 24mm f/2.8 ASPH. My SL2 failed to recognize this lens and I am sure my M10 Monochrom would not either.

I absolutely love my M10-M, and obviously my dream would be to keep it and also have a M11/M11-P concurrently, but that’s just not in my financial perimeters at this time. 

I was lucky enough to get a x100vi recently to fill my color itch, and I do enjoy the photos that come out of the Fuji, but I simply don’t find it as engaging or enjoyable to shoot with. 

I also prefer not having to rely on the extensive menu settings, AF, fixed lens, etc. 

I feel very in tune with my M10-M and lenses, and have had several film M bodies in the past. I shortly considered a Q body, but the M bodies feel natural and efficient to my workflow. 

I still plan to shoot mostly b&w but would love to have the option for color with a M body. 

I know that nothing can compare to a true monochromatic sensor, but would I truly miss the mono files and lowlight performance, or will the M11-P still satisfy me?

Take image in daylight hours, and viola!! ..you have your very own light leak in your image. 

Go to your Leica store and show them your creation and how you just love the result after spending all that money!

If you don’t like this result, you can borrow your wife/girlfriend/sisters ‘scrunchie’ ( a black hair band ) and put it around the mount of your lens whilst taking daytime long exposures. This is a unique Leica experience!

1fyorbz,"Sloped, ground cam of M-mount lenses and focusing coupling","(Descriptions of the photos at the bottom of the post.)

So, I’ve found out this whilst looking for some information about 90 mm M-mount lenses.
I wanted to get a 90 mm lens and was gonna get an M-Rokkor 90 mm (Minolta), but some people on the internet appeared to be saying contradicting things.

It seems some 3rd-party M-mount lenses have ground (thereby sloped) cams (the part that pushed the focusing cam of your M-mount camera in as you focus to the infinity) because they spin as the focusing ring of the lens spins rather than coming in and out perpendicularly without spinning.

(Some claimed that this is because those lenses do not have the same structure of the Leica lenses’ helicoid, which are expensive to produce)

Nevertheless, since the cam of those lenses is sloped and the focusing coupling is carried out by the gradient of the slope (rather than the parallel movement of the cam in and out), it might cause focusing shift unless the focusing cam is absolutely centred at all time.

Therefore, M6 and later cameras have different focusing cam arms, the position of which is always centred, can be used with no problems with those lenses, but some other old Leica M cameras cannot be compatible.

It seems this is a real issue since I’ve been a post in this forum that someone bought a “Leitz made” M-Rokkor 90 mm for his M3 and experienced severe focusing shift in the results. The “Leitz made” M-Rokkor 90 mm is known to have a very steep focusing cam apparently, but the later models made in Japan (by Minolta) have somewhat relatively more flat focusing cam.

So, what I want to be clarified here are:
1. Which lenses have those sloped cams?
2. Which lenses with the sloped cams can one use with no problems regarding this focusing shift issues?
3. Can I use an M-Rokkor 90 mm lenses with my M3?

I’ve seen some products on eBay and let me share the photos of the cams with you because I have another question about them.

1st photo: an M-Rokkor 90 mm (Minolta) from eBay. Shows slightly ground and sloped cam. 

2nd photo: another M-Rokkor 90 mm (made by Leitz) from eBay. Note that there is a indent on the edge of the cam, almost looking like a chip-out. 

3rd photo: same product as the 2nd photo, another angle.

What is the indent on the 2nd and 3rd photos and why is it there? I understand the cam can be sloped continuously to push the cam arm of the camera, but this does not make any sense to me.

Any help would be appreciated. Let’s share out wisdoms.",3,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fyorbz,No-Tailor-2020,1728352241,10/8/24 1:50,6,,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0

After a couple years I got out of the camera equipment hobby (to go to other collectible hobbies)  and liquidated all my cameras and equipment, other than the original Sony RX1 FF and Sony RX 10 fixed zoom.   I still actively photograph with both cameras, using the RX1 about 75% of the time.  In the past couple of weeks, as I approach retirement, I started to poke around the interwebs to see what advancements have been made with FF fixed lenses in the past 10 years to compliment the 2 cameras I have that still take great photos, despite being a bit tech-dated.  Only today did I discover the release of the Q3 43, and like a board hitting me in the head, I knew it was ""the one"".   It would be the perfect compliment to the RX1 35mm focal length.   

Unfortunately, the Leica website is just taking email addresses as they list it on backorder, but that New York online photography vendor was still accepting orders, even though it could not confirm timing of shipment.  The order has been placed.   Hopefully it is days or a few weeks, versus a months long wait to receive.  I'm very excited.   I was actually about to pull the trigger on a whole Ooni pizza setup, but I guess that's gonna have to wait.  I get to try the starving artist routine first with this new camera.

1fxgg9z,Leica M10 (2019) issues with shutter button sticking and lens mount loose,"TL:DR
M10 2019 shutter button intermittently regularly doesn't depress, lens mount loosens. Insight please.

Leica M10, bought 2019. Well used, but looked after. This is my 2nd ""modern"" Leica and I am 25 years into using them.

The shutter button intermittently sticks. I was taking photos and half way into shooting, I had taken multiple shots that day, the shutter button stopped working. It would not depress. A few days later I tried again, it worked. A few days after that it stopped again.

I have a high end ""camera fixer company"" who have done work for me tightening the lens mount (see later) who reviewed it for me. Whilst reviewing obviously Sod's Law it worked. His recommendation was to make lots of notes the next time it happened to help him diagnose. It's happened again, there's nothing of note, it just doesn't depress.

Has anyone else had a similar experience?

Addionally I have now had to have the lens mount tightened twice because of whatever reason I don't know. I know it has happened because the focus starts to fail.

Aware Leica can be temperamental, not experienced this before. Anyone who can shed some (PLEASE PROPER) technical light on this. TY",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/1fxgg9z/leica_m10_2019_issues_with_shutter_button/,ianwallis,1728221177,10/6/24 13:26,6,,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0

1fx647c,"A bit of a lens comparison, inc. some Soviet lenses and an explanation focusing accuracy issues","After picking up an M240 recently, I'd noticed a bit of weirdness with a pre-war Sonnar which I've used for years without issue on film, so I thought I'd do a quick focusing test in my office using a box of flashbulbs angled at 30-45º, positioned 1m away from the sensor, and I figured I'd also take the opportunity to do a bit of a PSA. 

All lenses were focused on the I and the C in the magicube box with the rangefinder in the M240, \*not\* the live view, and are wide-open, unless otherwise noted.

Here's our baseline - a collapsible Summicron, recently totally overhauled by Skyllaney:

[Perfectly sharp, nice rendering, focus is where I want it to be - the M in magicube is just dropping out of focus. ](https://preview.redd.it/mg61jwlfj1td1.jpg?width=5952&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8aeb8aa237249e97faaf2cce072ca64ef312b53d)

Next up, purely for comparison, is a (clean!) uncoated Summar:

[Perfectly useable, nice and sharp, out of focus areas are a bit wilder and the colour is a bit less rich, but compares well with the Collapsicron.](https://preview.redd.it/5fl0lwvpj1td1.jpg?width=5952&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3485c986b7a797437bfb1e7c6c3a935e684c9ff7)

And here's the 50/1.5 Sonnar at f/1.5 on an Amedeo adapter:

[Noticeably a bit softer at all points - but also noticeably front-focusing, which I hadn't noticed on film. I could shim this for wide-open use, but it's close enough that I'm not that concerned.](https://preview.redd.it/bob39fdzj1td1.jpg?width=5952&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e5eface5bedd7a275b0051ea359a51337dddd6a)

After looking at this, I thought I'd dig out a (very) late ""Jupiter 8M"" (big asterisk on that) in Kiev mount to see how it compares and check the adapter is accurate:

[Focus is exactly where it should be. This is a really nice lens - it's actually in a Helios-103 style lens housing, which is rare. Upon cleaning it I found it seems to be a Helios-103 design inside, so I think this is a transition lens. Definitely a keeper.](https://preview.redd.it/zpamo7o7k1td1.jpg?width=5952&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b6073746f6a2a0d43c58725803b06486c86f21e8)

But I've said a few times in here over the years that Soviet ""LTM"" lenses back focus on a Leica. Want to see how bad it is?

[Hoooo boy. This backfocuses so badly you can actually start to get an idea of how messy my office is! This Jupiter 8 works perfectly fine on a Zorki - it's \*not\* defective. This is how post-war Soviet lenses were built.](https://preview.redd.it/artvbimlk1td1.jpg?width=5952&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fdca4c066acdc4ab6cdb85092806a2d9968322a1)

Where things get really interesting, however, is this one:

[This is a pre-war \\""FED 50\\"", aka. an \\""Industar 10\\"". It's a very close Elmar clone, and I bought it attached to a post-war Zorki. It never worked on the Zorki, so I put it on a shelf. Turns out this is because it's built to Leica spec - while there's a lot more depth of field at f\/3.5, this is exactly bang on focus. Post-war 50\/3.5 collapsible Industar lenses exhibit the same back-focusing of the Jupiter above.](https://preview.redd.it/tmaxwfxsk1td1.jpg?width=5952&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e863f167ea34b07e9376eceadb80e5ddc39e92b9)

So, for those who aren't aware, the history and the theory is this: Soviets copied the Leica directly before World War II. Early FEDs (like early Leicas) weren't standardised, but it seems they were actively meeting Leica specification at some point before the war, if this FED 50 is to be believed. But after the war is over, the Soviets take the Contax designs and tooling, and every rangefinder lens and body made by the Soviet camera industry from that point on is built to the Contax specifications - even if they ostensibly have an LTM mount. The difference in what the two rangefinders took as the standard focal length (51.6mm for Leica, 52.4mm for Contax, if I remember right) is enough to cause real focusing issues. 

You can see this yourself: if you set up a 1m ""test bed"" with any Leica and an unmodified Soviet ""LTM"" lens, the rangefinder can be in focus, but the focus scale on the lens will be closer to 1.1m. If you used live view, the lens would be in focus when set to 1m, but the rangefinder will appear way out. The issue seems to be how the lens interacts with the rangefinder, not the actual flange focal length. 

So by taking the Kiev-mount version of those same lenses (the optics were basically interchangeable, from what I understand - it's probably the need for simplification and standardisation that led to the ""LTM"" ones being so far out from Leica spec) and putting them into an Amedeo adapter that is designed to interact with the Leica rangefinder correctly, you can actually use these Soviet lenses with accurate focusing.

After much debate (and trying out multiple cameras), I decided on getting the M5. It is not the most loved amongst Leica purists, but coming from a Non-Leica background, I didn't have attachments to the classic M look. 

I tried the M4, M4-2, and M2 as well. My local shop had them in stock and he allowed me to test the cameras. The M5 felt the most robust and fit my hand perfectly. After 20 years shooting the Nikon professional line of DSLRs, the M5's size felt perfect - not as big, but not too small. 


As far as ergonomics, it also felt the best. The viewfinder was the brightest. The ability to see my shutter speed and exposure meter in the viewfinder was a major plus. The shutter dial was perfectly placed and allowed for quick changes. 

The meter was also spot on. I double checked the reading with my phone app and a Sekonic L358 light meter. 

This is my second time considering a Leica. The first was a couple years back when I sold all my digital gear and went full analog. At that time, I was deciding between the M3 and the Nikon SP. The Nikon SP won my heart at that time (it is the most beautiful Nikon camera ever made IMHO). Plus, I got a solid deal for it - someone wanted to trade theirs for my Steam deck! It has since become my go to camera and got me hooked on rangefinders!

Fast forward to today and finally got my First Leica. I splurged and put a roll of PORTRA 800 in it to test it out. Excited to see the results and use it more. 

The price to performance ratio of the M5 is amazing IMHO. I got mine for $1250 from a local shop I trust (I've bought a few cameras there before, and he has CLA'd a handful of my cameras including the 1957 Nikon SP, the original Rollei 35, Mamiya RB67, and Nikon F). 

It included a fresh CLA, a mint condition Voightlander 35mm f/2.5 Color Skopar, a leather case, and a 6 month warranty.

1fwq5pr,Leica iiia with Canon 50mm 1.8(silver) Focusing issue,"Hello! I just got this combo (1930s iiia) and tried it in a photowalk. Then after developing, I see that all photos using f1.8 and f2 were back focused. The rangefinder in the iiia is infinity calibrated and I'm sure that I focused correctly in every frame.

Photos that were focused to infinity like trees and buildings using f8 to f16 were super sharp. If I use f4 and f5.6 and the subject is about ⁶ft then it is sharp.

I tried mounting the Canon lens to my 1950s iiif and even checked both the viewfinder and the focal plane using ground glass and the lens and the iiif is calibrated. I cant think of a way to do this on the iiia since the lens mount is attached to the body casing when disassembled.

Now my question is, do pre war leicas have compatibility issues with non-leitz lens? Ive heard that this is true for FSU lenses but have not heard for japnese lens.

1fwmbt0,Have your Leica changed your way of shooting? Or have any other camera made you change how you shoot?,"There was interesting thread here in reddit on this sub where it was asked if people have other cameras as well ([thread is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/1fwfkx7/what_other_camera_non_leica_do_you_shoot_with/)). It was interesting to see that at least many seem to have other cameras as well (as well as I have) and that made me wonder that since many people have many cameras from different brands, have shootig with Leica changed your way of work in any ways? Or have some other camera made you change your ways somehow? If so, what camera and how?

For starters, I have shot through the years with many point and shoots, DSLRs and a little bit with film SLR and point and shoot as well. 

Multiple cameras have changed way I shoot:  
- Fujifilm X-T2 changed that I felt in love with its siplicity - all the important buttons for normal shooting are dedicated buttons on top of camera. With Canons and Nikons what I had used previously those were not that intuitive. With this X-T2 I also started to use EV-compensation, I didn't even knew that kind of feature in Nikons and Canons because their usability have not been that logical for me.

- Later I bought Fujifilm X100F and that changed me that I started to take quite often black and white photos. I just loved those. With other cameras what I have owned I have not shot black and white almost ever (if ever). It changed me that way that I finally find joy of black and white photography.

- Film cameras, Chinon Ca-4s and Pentax something changed my way of shooting so I was able to shoot manual focus. It didn't felt strange anymore to use manual focus, and actually it was fun to shoot with manual focus. Also with film cameras it probably changed my mindset - there is no ""RAW to edit"", so if I shoot black and white, it is and will be black and white now and forever. With Fujifilm X100F and XT-2 I shot RAW + JPEG so I was able to change black and white to color photos later.

With film cameras I learnt also real value of printing photos. It just ""feels different"" and with every roll I shot and developed at home I selected some photos to print. When I used development lab I always got whole roll on paper and it was so fun to put those memory photos to albums.

- Leica D-Lux (Typ 109) - My current camera (among others). With this camera (probably thanks to experience with film cameras) I finally are fine again shooting JPEG only. I have not any RAW with this, I just don't care anymore. It is what it is. This is also first digital camera where I have started to shoot almost everytime using that small EVF instead of LCD (unless necessary to use LCD).

With all the ""changes"" in my shooting style with those cameras I have adopted them to this Leica. I love that I can set shutter speed and aperture with physical buttons, EV-compensation is very handy, I use manual focus instead of autofocus and EVF instead of LCD almost all the time. Also as mentioned I shoot only JPEG and probably 80 % to 90 % of time I have shot black and white.

With this camera I have also started to shoot differently and ""see differently"". I am not that obsessed anymore with ""perfectly in focus"" and sharpness, instead my mindset have changed to see photography more as an ""artform"" instead of ""technical stuff"". 

I don't know for sure why this change in mindset has happened, but I think it is because I have started printing photos. With film cameras I started this printing because it just ""felt necessary"" (even it was not since I scanned those photos), but this Leica is the first digital camera for me where I have developed a habit to print almost daily. When I shoot even random photos I like to print some of them. When I see photos in paper, I just look at the photo and feel the emotion and I don't care that much about technical aspects. Sometimes blurry photo with emotion is much better than perfectly sharp photo without any ""feeling"".

Many cameras have changed my way of working and with this Leica all those habits have become a norm.

What mostly changed in my photography with this Leica then? Amount of shooting. I felt totally in love with shooting ""more seriously"" but still that it is not feeling ""serious"" but just fun and inspiring. For more serious shooting I mean that I have started to look for shooting places and drive there to take photos every week. I have owned this camera about 1,5 month and I have shot with this so much that it is already my third mostly used camera in my 20 year of photography and those most used and second most used camera I have used years. 

It have just felt fun to shoot and go out and it has given me so much joy that I have made me go outside much more. This camera have changed the way I shoot a lot because I think I finally started to find ""my style"", maybe it is because I shoot so much and print so much that I have noticed patterns what kind of photography I like to take, but that would have not happened if I haven't felt in love with this camera and started to shoot so much.

Whoah, this is a long post :D Anyway, if you have any stories to tell, it would be awesome to hear how different cameras have changed the way you work!

1fwd9ts,"First Leica. M 242, M10? ","Hello everyone,

I’m slowly getting ready to purchase my first Leica. On a daily basis, I use a Nikon ZF/Z8 and Voigtlander lenses. I wanted to buy a Leica as my go-to camera for street photography and as a second, or even top camera for documentary photography, adding something extra to my usual setup.

After some initial research, I concluded that the Q2 is excellent in terms of price and quality. I managed to borrow the Q3 from a nearby store for a few hours, took it out for some street photography, and... I didn’t like it. I was completely disappointed by the experience of shooting with this camera and couldn’t shake the feeling that if I didn’t enjoy the Q3, the Q2 would be even less of a valuable addition to my kit. When I returned the Q3 and shared my impressions, I was compelled to try the M11 with an APO-Summicron 35 f2 lens. And now I get what’s all the fuss about. It’s hard to put into words the experience of shooting with this camera and lens. Something magical, inexplicable—the most extraordinary, satisfying photographic experience I’ve ever had due to the gear. I’m in love. I can’t sleep because every night I keep thinking back to this experience.

Now, here’s my question. To be able to buy the M11 with the APO-Summicron, I’d have to sell my apartment and sign at least two pacts with the devil. Currently, I’m considering the M10 or the M 242. I’ve heard great things about the M 242, and it’s reasonably priced. Is the M10, which is twice as expensive, worth it? Or maybe there’s another model I’m overlooking?

1fvsllx,Thoughts on the Leica Q3 43mm? Would you keep it long-term?,"
I’m a huge fan of the M-body Leicas. For me, they’re the perfect balance between manual control and digital convenience. What I love most is the ability to meter, focus, and shoot without ever needing to look at a screen or EVF. The newer models still give you the peace of mind that comes with digital, but the shooting experience feels timeless.

Now, the Q3 43mm looks amazing—has all the features, and from what I’ve seen from influencers, it shoots absolute bangers. But here’s where I’m torn. The Q3 feels more like a classic mirrorless camera, similar to what you get from Fujifilm or Sony. Is it really the kind of camera you’d hold onto for the long term? Or does it seem like a piece of tech that’ll eventually be overhauled, unlike the M bodies that still have people drooling after a decade?

I don’t mean this as any hate. I’m genuinely curious to hear thoughts. I’m also drawn to the Q3 (IBIS!), but every non-M mirrorless camera I’ve owned has ended up getting sold because they didn’t give me the shooting experience I wanted. I often found myself switching back to film or something more engaging.

1fvmstk,M Grip (IDS Works Modular vs KameraKraft LM Grip V3),"I wanted to post my impressions and a short comparison of the IDS M film body grip and the KameraKraft LM Grip V3. 
I initially purchased the IDS for 2 primary reasons. 
1. It had no wait list - would ship immediately.
2. I liked the design of the integrated lock release.
It does seem well thought out and well machined. The lock mechanism is nice and the packaging is adequate. 

The reason I returned it was that there is a gap- see photos- between the grip and the camera bottom plate. It’s small but I could not help but see it each time I looked at the camera. I emailed the company (Henry) and asked about the gap. 
He replied promptly and told me it was normal and that there was essentially nothing to be done about it. He did say I could place a small slice of paper on one of the rubber bumpers to level it out. 
I asked to return the grip and he agreed but I would have to pay shipping. I did return it and he promptly refunded my payment. He did this even before it returned to me. Overall, even though I returned the grip I would say it was a good customer experience. 

I then messaged the KameraKraft instagram to ensure the same issue would not happen. 
Had a great chat with Vincent. He assured me the same issue would not occur. 
I ordered his V3 grip and it arrived about a week later. It is fantastic. It is slimmer than the IDS and has no gap. The actual grip shape is better, provides more area for my fingers to grip. It does not have two screws in the grip which I prefer. The only negative I can find is the color of the metal does not match my camera. I have a silver M7 so this may not be an issue for the black M film cameras. The IDS did better match the color. 

Additionally it just comes in a plastic bag.  Not a problem as I will never use the packaging again. If you’re someone who is really into the packaging experience you may be a little let down. 

I do not like the Leica grip option as the camera will not sit flat with that grip - it’s a half bottom plate grip.

Why not just get the 2022 M6 if money matters not? Because I think I'd prefer the .85 of the M6 TTL but unsure. I use a 35 and a 50 with the M and with the .85 like the idea of the viewfinder being the full image, sort of like a DSLR. 

And why the M7? Because I think in a pinch the aperture priority mode could be fun and convenient. But I'm afraid the circuit board being old tech might impact its long term repairability. Same with the M6 TTL. 

And the 2022 M6 is in the mix for obvious reasons - it's brand new, warranty, has a new PCB, brass top plate, better MP viewfinder. It feels like it has the best heirloom potential of the three. 

MP isn't a candidate because I don't like that type of black paint and/or the heavy brassing it would incur. And don't want silver. ",6,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/1fvm4oo/between_m6_ttl_2022_m6_or_m7_help_me_decide/,bwehman,1728000288,10/4/24 0:04,13,,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0

On one hand, I’m coming from a 22mp sensor and would love to upgrade to a higher resolution (40mp on the M10-R). On the other hand, many people say that you don’t need more than M10’s 24mp.

Considering the price difference (about $1,000 more on average for the M10R) and the fact that the R is also harder to find on the market, do people think it’s worth that extra money and effort to find one from a trusted seller? I could in theory just go for an M10 and put that extra cash toward lenses.

What do people think? I’d appreciate any other insights I might be missing from people who have used either / both.

1fusc7z,M4-P with Leica-meter MR or M6?,"Hi there,

I’ll hope you guys can give me some advise or thoughts. Currently I’m owning a M4-P which I love. I’m using it with the Lightme app on the iPhone. Last weekend my iPhone decided to throw a tantrum a there I was not knowing how to meter. I know sunny 16, but not enough that I’m comfortable with it.

Soooo I started looking in to the M6. I’m interested in a classic, non-TTL. But here comes the doubt; Zinc corrosion (brass ones are less common) and electronics. How well wil they held up? Some comments say if it any happend in the last 30 years I won’t in the next 30 years. I like the thought but isn’t it a bit optimistic?

Then I thought I’ll add a Leica-lightmeter MR tot my M4-P (which has brass top plate). But how good are those meters. They are around 200$ but it is still 500$ less then an upgrade to a M6 (depending on usage) with selling the M4-P. The Leica-Meter is (if correct me if am wrong) a global meter and the M6 is more a spot meter right? If a Leica-lightmeter breaks I can replace it my self 2-3 times depending on the price off course. If the Leica M6 meter breaks I’m having an M4-P.

I don’t really know what to did I miss stuff? Is it stupid? Good to know my photos are mostly holiday/street (easy with global metering) and some urbex stuff (nice to have spot metering with darker rooms). 

Hope you guys can give me food for thought.

Whereas I keep UV filters for protection on my SL2 and GFX lenses, I seem to have not done that with my M-series lenses, which I have 12 of.

Hello dear photography folks, friends & fanatics!

I honestly think i need your Leica-knowledge. But please allow me to share this story first. 

A while ago - during working on my old vw beetle - a friend approached me, telling me he found some old camera gear during renovation of his dads old house and he wanted me to have it. Days later he comes by, drops a huge box of stuff and leaves. So i spent the past months slowly going through this box from top to bottom, cleaning old and newer camera gear found in there and selling it to friends or online. The money i made with this i kept on the side for a later day so i could surprise my friend with what his ""trash"" was worth after all.

Yesterday i reached the box' bottom and there it was. While all the other gear were mainly old Minoltas and Nikos which i kind of know a bit about - all i know about old Leicas is that i don't know enough. To me it looks like the camera was barely used. It came with what you see on the image as well as the leather-carry-case. I did not try to clean any part of it so its looking as it was right out of the box. I did check that everything moves, nothing is corroded or stuck. I removed the Leica-Meter and the Serial is in the M3-737-XXX range if this helps identifying.   

These days i shoot with modern digital cameras but i never held a piece of gear that felt so refined and pure to me. Just holding it gives me a better feeling than with any modern cam i touched - and there are many :)  Sooo... i was thinking of getting it checked maybe and actually buying it off my friend and yeah ... using it. 

I just don't have any serious information whats it worth. Sure i tried searches online and such, but i feel there is a lot of money-focused sellers and a lot of misinformation. Maybe you good people could give me an idea where to head to, or what to check on the camera. 

I'll appreciate every input - thank you all in advance.

Question for those who know about Leica lenses (I don't know a lot). The 43 is a Summicron, and the 28 is a Summilux. As I understand it, the Summilux is a much better lens, though the Q3 43 is more expensive. Aside from the difference in f-stop - going from 1.7 to 2.0 wouldn't bother me - what differences are there between the two styles of lenses? 

One other thought. 43mm is an odd focal length, but in a promo video, someone said that 43mm is the diagonal of 24x36. Would that make any difference in the way a lens is manufactured? Is that some sort of magic number that allows the lens to work better with the sensor?

I'm wondering if I should keep it though. Has anyone experienced any regrets about the M10M? I've taken some quick shots tonight and they all look okay, but the quality of the image is not as mind-blowing as I expected based on numerous reviews. The noise (or, perhaps, the ‘grain’) with high iso is just fantastic: still, isn’t something I could possibly get from the M10p? Here are some simple shots from tonight.

1furhdo,Focus ring on LTM to M adapter question ,"Hi everyone, 
Has anyone had focus-ring turning issues with the Canon-LTM 28 f2.8 on a Leica?

I have the lens, put it on a Fotodiox 28/90 adapter, then on my M6. The focus is fine from 3.5 feet to 4 feet, stiff between 4 feet to 10 feet, then fine 10 feet to infinity. I got the same result with a couple of different Fotodiox adapters. To really make sure, I tried a Leitz-LTM 90 f4.5 on the same adapters and had no issues. 

Is this normal with the particular lens + adapter combo? Or am I looking at funky but otherwise great lens?

1ftl4v4,Leica buying advice (M11-p and APO 35mm?),"Hi guys,

Need some buying advice. I currently have a GR iiix and a X100VI. I use Lightroom for post-processing with everything \[stored\] in the cloud. With the GR iiix I prefer to use the jpegs, as I find the lens corrections in Lightroom too stark. I only shoot raw with X100VI. 

I’m considering: Leica M11-p with Leica APO-Summicron-M 35mm f/2 ASPH. I won't bother with several lenses.

Rationale:

* Family life \[first baby any day now\] is next up for me, with much more ‘slow time’ both in the city and at cabins etc at least for the first year.
* I think I’ll enjoy the rangefinder experience, and of course if feels good that the camera and the lens is expert craftmanship.
* I like the toned down look of the M11-p and that it’s a bit less weight than the chrome/brass one.
* I want photos that are, by default, as natural as possible. I really dislike how computationally generated most nowadays images are. Even the GR iiix and X100VI have a lot of corrections.

However, I’m a bit worried about all the discussions on M11 / M11-p being poor at setting the white balance, thus with colors that are off, causing additional time spent in Lightroom to get a natural look. I want to spend as little time in Lightroom as possible, while still having the option to work on the photos in post.

Any advice on workflow, or another camera combination that better suits my needs?",12,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/1ftl4v4/leica_buying_advice_m11p_and_apo_35mm/,Evleos,1727779780,10/1/24 10:49,47,,FALSE,1727785124,0,0,0

It wasn't taking pictures, since the file count didn't increase, it almost seemed like it was doing pixel mapping. But from what I've at least glanced at, pixel mapping has to be run the camera doesn't do it automatically (unless I'm mistaken).

It occurs to me that I could consolidate both cameras into a single M11 and use the Visoflex 2 for the telephoto stuff, which I need to do only occasionally. I’m good with an RF and could go back to using it with the fast lenses pretty painlessly. And I’d get an M11 upgrade, although that’s not something I’m feeling a huge need for.

I don’t really use the SL2-S for autofocus. I own a 24-70 but the setup is so big that it almost never leaves the house. An M11 plus Visoflex would be smaller and simpler.

Would you make the switch? Suppose you’re photographing a kids’ play in a school auditorium, or a soccer game with a 135mm Tele-Elmar. Would the Visoflex 2 work for you, or would an SL EVF make a big difference?",2,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/1fta5o6/visoflex_vs_sl_for_telephoto/,mrjosh72,1727739669,9/30/24 23:41,2,,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0

1ft7iui,Question about winding advance level,"Hi! I tried a Leica M2 today that was in a very good condition, and I didn't like the sound/feel of the advance lever at all. I like a more clicky tactile advance mechanism, yet I was surprised at how Leica's was only with one click towards the end, and the rest of the way is just ""smooth"".

Is this something that is a characteristic of the M2 and was changed in later models like M4-2, M6, etc? or all Leicas have this smooth non-tactile advance mechanism?

I watched some videos online where I could hear that the sound sounds a bit more tactile but I'm not sure.

Is this something that bothers you or you grew to love?

EDIT: I don't mean to offend anyone with this, I respect Leica a lot and have been researching to get one for a long time, I just tried it today for the first time in my hands and still processing whether it is for me or not.

1fs3e1y,Operation on M10-P Safari: Rangefinder Lever Lubrication,"I’ve just done something I think a lot of folks here might find interesting: lubricating a stiff rangefinder lever/coupling on my Leica M10-P Safari!

**Symptoms:** The rangefinder patch would move only partially or freeze when turning the lens. Sometimes it would jump ahead or get stuck ""inside"" the body (see picture) and needed a little nudge to pop out.

**Solution:** I removed the top case (following a YouTube guide—link below), applied a bit of CST100 oil to the friction points, and reassembled. I used 100-weight oil designed for RC parts. The key is that the oil works on brass and sticks well to the component. I just used a small needle to apply it.

**Important note:** There are two flex cables between the top cover that you’ll want to disconnect when removing it—don’t forget this step!

Honestly, I was a bit nervous about trying this myself and doubted whether I should even attempt it. But with some background in phone and PC repairs, I figured it couldn’t be that different—and it wasn’t! Just take it slow and dont rush.

**Sources I used:**

1fsa27c,"Will be selling off SL3, Q2 Monochrom, Q2, and lenses.  Decided to simplify and use an M and a Q only.","Hi everyone.  I'm going to be posting some items for sale later today or tomorrow, over on r/photomarket.  I have bought all of the Q series over the years, except for the new 43mm model.  Loved each one more, and decided that the Q3 is good enough to be my ""only"" camera.  Of course, I've also realized that as I get older I hate carrying around heavy lenses.  I bought the SL3 thinking it would be fun to shoot with M lenses, and it is.  But it's also still a bigger camera than the M.  And since the Q3 is so, so good,I realized, I can live with the Q3 being my only autofocus camera, and I can use the M11 when I just want to go slow and enjoy the experience.

Accordingly, I've decided to simplify, and I'm going to shoot with just my Q3 and my M11 for now.  So these are the items that I'll be selling on to a new home:

\* Leica SL-3 (mint, inner and outer boxes)

\* Leica Q2 Monochrom (mint, inner and outer boxes)

\* Leica Q2 (used, inner and outer boxes)

\* Leica APO-Summicron-SL 50mm f/2 (mint, inner and outer boxes)

I'd like to feel a bit more confident with my decision before I break the seal on the box, otherwise I'm looking at having to resell or eat a 15% restocking fee.

Some background: I'm at best a middling photographer and it's just a hobby. I live in the mountains (Lake Tahoe) and want to do some landscapes and certainly some good photos of my 2.5 year old daughter as she grows up. And just have an excellent camera for travel.

My last camera was a Fujifilm X-T4 with a handful of lenses, and before that I had a Fujifilm X100F, and a X100S before that. I shot the most photos with the X100 series cameras by far. I've since sold them all.

I love the simplicity of a fixed lens because I'm not lugging around extra gear, and I just have to move myself to get the right shot.

I only want to have one camera, plus my iPhone 16 Pro.

But 28 or 43? I know it's super subjective but I've got to the point that I'm over thinking this extra perspective would help.

Edit: I got the Q3 a few days ago and I'm certainly keeping it. For indoor shots of the kid it's exactly right. I can get closer when I want to, and don't have to backup too much.

For outdoor shots I'm pretty happy with it also. A few places I was taking some shots of the lake and would have liked to get in closer. The water kept me from walking closer. But that's just the kind of tradeoff you make with a fixed lens. Overall I'm really happy with it.

1frjsvj,Flash suggestions for M-P 240,"Would love some advice on selecting a flash for my M-P 240. I’ve been doing a lot of research but am still confused about what works best for me…

I am mainly looking to use flash in situations like family events and parties, documentary style, usually f4-8. 

I have experience with using manual flash on a film camera and was happy with the results I got from simply alternating between two distance settings. But I imagine film is more forgiving, and digital may require more precision. 

Is TTL necessary for the scenarios that I’m describing, or would I be fine with something off brand? 

Are there any major compatibility issues I should be aware of?

Based on the initial reviews, I thought the decision on which one to keep would be easier, but it's turning out to be more complicated than I expected. For moving subjects, like my kids, the autofocus on the Q3 definitely makes it easier to nail focus. However, when it comes to overall image quality, comparing the Q3's output to that of my M11 paired with a Voigtlander 50mm APO, I find it hard to choose a clear winner. In terms of handling, I much prefer the M11; the Q3 feels a bit like an expensive toy to me.

1fopqdf,"Follow my head, heart, or back?  -  ZF, SL, A7cii","Howdy y'all. I'm reconsidering dipping my toe back into mirrorless after using the following camera systems (in order) fuji x100, a7r1, xt1, x pro 2, ricoh gr, pentax k3, pentax k1ii, m240, x100v, x pro 2, d700, s5 pro, d4s, rx1rii, d810.

I went back to DSLRs after getting frustrated with the headachy EVFs about a year ago. Really found to appreciate the fast start-up times, amazing battery life, and solid builds of the pro Nikon DSLR bodies.

My photography background is mostly surrounding studio product photography, weddings/events, and lifestyle family work. Lately however, I'm doing more landscape photography on backpacking trips, which means the bulky DSLR kit is on the chopping block. I'd like to reduce weight, and physical size, as the rest of my backpacking gear (including tripod and fishing gear) is around 10lbs. Plus adding the features that mirrorless provides, like Eye-AF, and IBIS, are two features I miss.

The F-mount collection is: D700, D810, 28mm 1.4e, 105mm 1.4e, 180mm 2.8, 90mm 2.8 APO Skopar, and tamron 45 1.8

Wow these E series nikkors are stunning lenses, and I think they'd work even better on a modern mirrorless nikon with eye detection! The 28E went on a four day colorado backpacking trip and the images it produced on the d810 were impressive.

  
I've come to reddit to get some opinions from folks that have used more modern mirrorless systems, as I have not. My main options currently, are the Nikon ZF, Leica SL2, and Sony A7cii systems. The ZF would allow me to adapt my current DSLR lenses which sound great initially... but the handling of the 105e, or 28e look like they'd be pretty rough on a ZF. The Nikon would definitely need a grip, which would add some weight and still not provide great ergonomics. The Leica SL2 system is alluring for the stout grip, amazing EVF, and build quality. It's still heavier than the ZF+grip by a few oz, but looks to have far superior handling.  Lastly, the a7cii seems to check most of my boxes, as it's the lightest, and smallest, with A-tier autofocus, and huge lens ecosystem. I've struggled to bond with any/every sony camera I touch however.

What do y'all think? Ditch F-mount entirely for sony/leica? Or give the ZF a go, to access my old lenses, plus the Z mount line?

Used ZF's run around $1500  
Used SL's - $2300  
Used A7Cii - $1700

Update-I had a long call with Sherry Krauter yesterday and told her about the cameras. She said that the m6 has a circuit board issue and if it’s gone bad there is no fix. Leica doesn’t make a replacement board. They want people to buy the new m6.

She said this is definitely not the deal of a lifetime and she’s been working on leicas for 40+ years

I haven’t seen the cameras in person. But it’s a huge risk due to potential repairs-the cameras might not work at all. Just the basic lubricants will be about $450 each camera and they both will need that.

I missed some shots because it would go into its stupid sleep mode - my Contax and Q20ii flashes never goes into sleep mode, and I could capture moments even after not pressing the shutter for minutes. With the SF24D I have to look down to see if the thing is ready to fire or not. And it would not wake up even after half shutters.  
Worse, it sometimes fired and did not recharge for another burst until I turned it off and on again. (The OK button not lighting up green).

I recently went to a trip to Japan and had to ditch the stupid thing and just ended up using the Q20ii again (although, this thing also has a stupid problem of its ""remote"" thing going to sleep after about 30 mins - still way better than SF24D going to sleep every 60 seconds).

1fo3w9l,Buying advice - 1st M body,"My 40th is coming up and celebrating being a geriatric millennial by getting a Leica M! 

I am down to two choices that will not break my retirement accounts. I looked at eBay but decided to buy local and skip some for the headaches. 

I am buying from a local camera repair shop - someone I trust and bought from before. This shop has CLAd 4 of my classic cameras (including a 1957 Nikon SP, a Rollei 35, and a Mamiya RB67). I've also bought from him a couple cameras before. He CLAs all cameras he sells and give a decent warranty (for a used camera). 

Based on the options below, what are your thoughts? 

Option 1: Leica M5 with 35mm color Skopar. Camera is CLAd, all shutter speeds sound ok, meter works, rangefinder patch looks good. 

The only con is a crack on the viewfinder glass - which doesn't affect the view when looking through the viewfinder. Otherwise, camera is in mint condition. 

Price is 1.4k including taxes. 

Option 2: Leica M4 with 35mm color Skopar. Camera is CLAd, all shutter speeds sound ok, rangefinder patch looks good. 

Camera is mint condition. 

Price is 1.9k including taxes. 

Note: lens can be ""unbundled"" and he can subtract 300 if buying body only. 

Note 2: I played with both today, and it seemed that the M5 viewfinder was brighter, but the M4 patch was more contrasty 

Note 3: there is a 3rd option in my local FB marketplace for a M4-2 with a Zeiss 35mm 2.8 for 1.5k. it's in the running, but it's just a little bit riskier than buying from eBay .

1fmsqlx,Honest review of my M11-D before returning it. ,"Yesterday I made a post about 5 day old  M11D locking up. I thought today I could provide a couple of honest thoughts about my experience using it up until that point. 

Let me preface this by the fact that, despite my D locking up and returning it, I really do still buy into the philosophy. For me, it’s ideal. 

However, after getting to use it for a few days, there were some real downsides that hinder the user experience that you might not realize until you really get to use it outside of the showroom. It’s also worth emphasizing that these downsides were design decisions made by Leica, and not a function of the philosophy itself. It’s particularly frustrating bc these issues cannot be remedied by a firmware update. You’ll just have to be comfortable with them wen you made the purchase 

The camera relies WAY too much, in my opinion, on the app. While from an outside perspective it might seem like a set it and forget it situation, the lack of ability to adjust basically anything from the camera itself means that you actually interface with the app almost as much as you would with the screen-this time it’s just more inconvenient. It would have been great if they, instead of just willy nilly got rid of buttons, knobs, etc., actually added a few of these so that you could change important settings without having to use the app. It’s counterintuitive, but by stripping it down to the degree that they have, they have actually forced the user to rely more on electronics than they would have if they just kept the original knobs and added one or two more buttons. 

I think that the lack of a screen was the most frustrating thing when my D locked up, and I think it was ultimately this which made me decide to ditch the D. It’s insanely frustrating to not have a screen when there’s something wrong with the camera and you can’t diagnose it. Chimping aside, there are real benefits to a screen when you are relying on electronics to the extent that this camera does.

I was offered the opportunity to modify my order to the upcoming 43mm Q3. And yes, $800 premium and extra wait for the privilege. 

As I have yet to shoot with a Q series camera, I am at odd on whether togo with 28mm or 43mm. 

Based on individuals who may have had a similar experience (shooting 35mm and change to 28mm of Q series). Was it a challenge? Given the opportunity to choose 43mm, would that have been the one you would have selected instead?  I shoot primarily street, and some portraits.

1fnhlq5,Purchasing advice for extending my photography kit (M11 the right choice? Upcoming trip to Japan),"Hi everyone,

I'm a proud owner of the Q3 which I was lucky to get end of July last year. And I really love the camera and the whole experience. I especially like the form factor as I take the camera almost everywhere - from the city to the mountains.

I am an ambitious hobbyist who has been taking photographs since childhood, both in analog and digital formats. Although I temporarily set aside this passion for a few years, I always intended to return to it. Thanks to the Q3, my enthusiasm for the hobby has sparked a lot again.

I have realized that I often prefer a longer focal length, as it allows me to better isolate a scene. I also tend to avoid invading people's personal space, which is why I believe a longer focal length can be beneficial at times for different pictures.

I've recently got the chance to try out the SL2 with the 24-90mm for a longer weekend, while I liked the digital experience a lot, the size and weight made me consider to just leave the camera at times already.

I've got a three week vacation in Japan upcoming for which I've been thinking whether to extend my photography kit for a while now. For which I'm considering a M11-P with a 50mm and maybe a 75/90mm.  
But I'm not entirely sure whether the rangefinder system is really right for my situations and for me to grow further as well. I'm also going into the direction of car photography for example.  
So naturally, my overthinking didn't stop there, as I've also took interest in an SL2/SL3, or a Hasselblad X1DII, or a Sony Alpha 7 IV or VR.

Has anyone of you in a similar situation? How did you decide? Or also in general, what would people in the sub recommend from their experience?

1fn1byz,Leica-Digital Workflow,"Hi all. I'm an experienced digital photographer who just picked up a Q3. I absolutely love the camera. I even love the FOTOS app. What I'm not so fond of, is spending hours in Lightroom.

Ideally, I would go straight from camera into my phone without the need for processing, but I find the Leica looks a bit extreme, and the out of camera jpgs a little lackluster. For reference, I love the workflow of the Ricoh GRIII. I program a few adjustments in the camera and simply transfer JPGS to my device. No need for Lightroom. As I understand it, that's simply not possible with the Q3, or am I missing something?

I would like to share my current Q3 workflow to see if people have ideas for improvement and hopefully hear some interesting ideas from this community.

Currently:  
I shoot in STANDARD mode.  
I use the fotos app to transfer the jpg and dng to my device.  
Most cases, I just do a little contrast boost, highlight and shadow adjustment and saves as JPG.   
In select cases, I use the DNG and do more precise editing using the EMBEDDED profile.

1fn3mii,Leica Q (type 116) shutter lifespan and repair cost,"Hi all, 

Has anyone experienced their Leica Q's shutter failing and therefore had to repair their leaf shutters repaired? In general I believe the leaf shutter lifespans is around 150K actuations going up to 200K. When I am with my daughter on holiday, I take lots of photos as every moment is precious to me. During this summer holiday in August, my file number increased about 80K, indicating that I triggered the shutter activation about 80K times. 

I have no desire to slow down when it comes to capturing the moments with my daughter as I'd buy another Q every summer if I have to - this is how much I adore all of my little girl's photos that I made with Q. But I've become curious and was wondering if anyone has experienced their leaf shutter failed and had to get the mechanism repaired. If they did, how much was the cost and at around what shutter counts did you experience the shutter failure? By the way, I am based in the UK FYI.

1fm6vcz,M11-D lock up ,"Hey y’all, since I’m probably the first person that this has happened to, I just want to alert you to an experience that I just had. Last night, I was out shooting, and all of a sudden the camera failed to fire. I hadn’t changed anything or done anything different to cause the issue. I was being shown the left hand arrow like you see when you’re shooting in manual mode, but I was in aperture priority. Removing and reinstalling the battery didn’t solve the problem, and it’s worth noting that the battery was around 60%. All of the buttons were non responsive, including the ones used for a hard reset. When i got home, I changed the battery and that seemed to resolve the issue—it had to be a bad battery, right? Well, no. This morning I wake up and just double checked, and the problem reoccurred with every battery this time. Folks at my Leica store also couldn’t figure out a solution either. They provide great customer service, and happily took my return. I am now a proud owner of an M11-P. They had another D and offered me that one, but between this issue and the card formatting oversight, I just couldn’t feel comfortable with this system anymore. A really cool idea, but in all honesty I didn’t find the day-to-day difference to be all that significant.

1fllghn,Interested in buying my first Leica (Q Series),"Looking to get back into photography…I dabbled a bit back in my high school days when I took a film photography class, and loved processing and delveloping film. 

In the 2000’s I purchased a lomography Diana medium format camera, and a Sony point and shoot digital camera. Had some fun with those cameras but eventually got busy and lost interest.

Fast forward to present day, I’m expecting the birth of my first child and I’m thinking having a dedicated camera other than my iPhone would be a good investment to capture memories.

I am an amateur photographer at best, but always loved taking landscape photos along my hiking treks, and photos of buildings, architecture, or anything else that caught my eye. 

Looking at point and shoot cameras today lead me to the Fuji X100 series and Leica Q series. Both cameras have that vintage film camera look that I absolutely love. Both seem like very capable cameras given my primitive photography skills. One thing that seems like a draw back is the $1000 over msrp price of the x100vi I’m finding online, and being able to get a Lecia Q or Q2 for $800-$1000 more.

I think I would be happier with the Leica because I love German design and engineering (my family is big into vintage Volkswagens, ‘67 and earlier). I also live close to a community college and would love to take a photography class to increase my knowledge and skills regardless of whatever camera I choose. 

I know Leica is more of a luxury brand name and with luxury products they may require maintenance that costs more than a Fuji film brand camera. But with used Leica Q prices so close to overpriced Fuji x100vi prices I’m finding it hard to justify paying $1000 over msrp rather than a camera that which seems to hold its value for longer.

There’s a good deal on a Leica Q-P close to me, but that price isn’t too far from a used Leica Q2. 

So many options and I’m just unsure of what the best option for me would be. This may be a biased question on a Leica forum but would getting a Leica Q series and learning how to use it over time be a better option than a new Fuji X100vi?

1fkgojd,Understanding the lenses,"Hiya, I’m new to the subreddit. 

Im looking for help understanding the difference between Leicas two main lenses, the Summilux and Summicron. 

From my understanding the lux is a f1.4 and the cron is a f2.0

My problem is that the videos I’m watching don’t exactly explain what the differences in function are between them. Is having that additional f-stop on the Summilux a straight upgrade or does it come with its drawbacks even when just using f2.0 on it?

Also, the videos I watch keep mentioning “speed”. Are they referring to focussing speed or shutter speed or something else?

——

My longer story of how I got here:

I started with Canon XTi in 2006, thought I wanted more and something faster, so I got the Canon 7D. Too heavy and hated the colours. My coworker showed me and sold me his Fujifilm x100s. That thing was simple and made be so creative! Started learning how to shoot manual with that camera, but always did autofocus. Sold all my Canon gears. Wanted to explore other Fuji lenses so I got a x-t1. I still have this camera today and is reluctant to sell it. It still is a very ergonomic and capable camera with beautiful colours. 

I stopped photography when life got busy — work, marriage, kids, and all. Stupidly thought maybe buying a new camera with a higher resolution and faster AF will get me into photography again. Plus, would be good for taking pictures of the kids, so I got a x-t5. Realized that I use that thing so rarely. As much as it’s feature packed and has everything people have wished for, it’s just too heavy and clunky for me. I never even took it outside, only done indoor portraits with it. The files were too big and I did not want to deal with them. So I went down the rabbit hole of buying and selling other cameras (including the xe4, x100v/vi, xpro2), but none of them really inspired me to shoot more. I sold them all except the x70 & Ricoh griii because they are so small and nice. But I still end up using my iPhone more because it’s just right there. 

Then, I stumbled upon a Q and wow. What a lens and camera combo. It’s special, and I want to shoot with it. Loved the 28mm, the wide aperture, and that I could practice manual focus with it. It’s such a flexible camera and I am willing to bring it to places and take it out to shoot because of the IQ and what it can do (even though it still freezes on me every once in a while…).

Given the Q is a fixed lens, I wanted something with a longer focal length for variety, so I did a lot of research and decided to pull the trigger on this used m10-p with a 50mm summicron v4 (for the rendering, focus tab, size and look). I thought I sucked at manual focus at first, as the focus always seemed to be off by a bit. I was so frustrated - I thought I made a huge mistake with the purchase. But after lots of testing and looking it up, I identified that there was a focus patch horizontal alignment issue (even my focus patch at infinity was not aligned). I fixed it myself with this method (in case anyone reading this who might have the same issue - but please do it at your own risk: https://youtu.be/lE7Yh5BgJ0I?si=SMyhlaSjiI5GScoW). Now it focuses beautifully. With lots of practice, I realize that manual focus is not hard, but very satisfying when I get it right (esp. with my moving young kids)! 

I don’t know how Leica does it, but the images it produces just seem higher resolution and more dense and sharper (where it needs to be) than it is. The file sizes of the Q and m10-p are great to handle (I hated the big 40mp files from the x-t5 and x100vi - took forever to transfer from SD card, load into LR, and edit). 

The rendering of the m10-p with the 50mm summicron v4 is beautiful. For example, when I take a good portrait of my kids and I review the image, the areas that are in focus like their eyes are so clear and everything looks so natural. The out of focus areas are so pleasing to look at. It’s like I’m looking into their eyes. 

I feel like I’m finally creating something, not just switching some dials and pressing a button. A feeling I haven’t had in my photography journey maybe since the x100s. I’m thinking that I can finally sell everything else and just keep the Q and this m10-p. When I need autofocus, wider shots, and more flexibility, I use the Q. When I want closer shots, and have time for manual focus, I take the m10-p with the 50. They are simple, fun, keeps me challenged, and makes me want to shoot. Let’s not lie, but they are also just beautiful cameras to look at :)

I am grateful to be able to afford these two Leica setups, and I am in love with photography again. Thank you to everyone on this subreddit who has helped me find my way here.

1fj64tm,"Leica shooters who develop their own film, have you ever tried this?","Was wondering if anyone has tried this before and if there are any downsides? For a film like Ilford HP5+, I've seen people generally rate it for 400, 800 and 1600. However practitioners of the Sunny 16 rule will immediately notice that their shutter speed dials will usually have corresponding speeds of 250, 500, and 1000. I understand it's within the latitude of the film to easily handle 1/3-2/3 stops over and under but mentally it just seems easier to practice the Sunny 16 rule if this was the approach.

Question: Would it make sense to figure out your own HP5+ personal development times for EI 250, 500, 1000, 2000 with your developer of choice instead of approximating with the more common ISOs based on box speed of 400, 800, 1600?

1fiv0su,New Q3 owner and Lightroom issues,"Hi everyone, 

I am the proud owner of my first Leica, a new Q3. I am still in the process of learning the camera and the various menu and features. I have a Sony A7iii with a couple of lenses and shoot mainly as a hobby and for family and vacations. 

I shot some pictures over the last week and was saving them in DNG+JPG. I imported the pictures in Lightroom Classic. I see that Lightroom Classic doesn't have a color profile for the Leica Q3 and it defaults them to Apple Embedded Color Profile as soon as I do any edits in the Develop module. I was not very happy with the way the pictures looked so just to check I exported the DNG as a full sized JPG without doing any edits. I then compared them side by side to the JPGs directly saved by the camera. I am seeing that across pictures the in camera JPGs look far better than the exported DNG from Lightroom. Is this normal? 

I also tried adjusting the DNG to get a similar look to the in camera JPG but was unsuccessful. 

What is everyone else's usual workflow and saving preferences? Any tips on how to go about saving and handling edits? ",7,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/1fiv0su/new_q3_owner_and_lightroom_issues/,Godisadj001,1726566799,9/17/24 9:53,17,,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0

1fins57,Went with an m10-D instead of m11-D,"Just sharing some thoughts as it was about two months ago that I purchased an m10-D from the Leica classics online store from Italy. 

There were many signs/rumours that the m11-D was coming out by September and I figured that there wasn’t enough of a reason to wait, so I went with the 10 and saved a few grand. I also got the film advance thumb rest which I thought was a nice touch and have really enjoyed as a little fidget device while I’m out shooting street. But I’ll admit I was a bit worried if I would feel any buyers remorse once the 11-D came out.

Now, a few days after the m11-D has been officially announced, I’m still feeling quite happy with this decision (not because I don’t like the m11-D - I probably would have ended up going this way if I had not found a very good condition 10-D).

Anyways, hopefully the announcement of the 11-D opens up a few more 10-Ds on the used market and opens up the opportunity to others to enjoy this camera. If you’re in a similar position to where I was, and you are on the fence about it, my experience with this camera has been a real joy so far, and I would make the same decision today if given the choice again.

All this said, I’m feeling thankful for the very niche product they make, even though it seems to be a divisive one amongst enthusiasts. I hope the D variants will continue in future models if I should ever need to replace mine down the road. It’s a joy to use, and it may not be right for everyone, but it certainly feels right for me.

1fidnd7,The next lens dilemma for travel,"Hi! I currently have a Q and a m10-p with a 50mm summicron f2 v4. I love the fact that there’s only 1 lens on each body right now, and I can pick up either cameras for the 28mm vs. 50mm, or use the autofocus on the Q (say for kids/family activities) vs. manual focus on the M (for portraits and other types of photography for fun). 

However, I will be traveling soon and without the kids this time (rare!), and am wondering if I will be better off with my m10-p only if I don’t want to bring two bodies. So my options could be:

1) Bring the Q and call it a day. (Pro: light gear and flexible. Someone can take photos of me with autofocus.)
2) Bring m10-p with my 50mm cron, and add a 28mm elmarit/summicron/summilux (I really love the lux on my Q! But seems a bit redundant to also get a lux for my M. But the 28mm focal length can be great combo to add to my only 50mm lens)
3) Bring m10-p and get a 35mm fle v2 close focus (1 lens). I am fine with a 35mm too and this way I don’t need to change lens (which I dislike doing while on-the-go). It also adds another different focal length to my collection, and something more flexible on the m. 

If I do #2 or #3, I am hoping that the new lens will be useful in the long run too and not just for this trip. I am typically a wider shooter (28mm/35mm) but have recently loved the 50mm as well. I’d prefer to keep them f2 or wider but the elmarit’s size is really attractive as well. I know it’s a first world problem, but would love to hear from those who have built up their Leica gears and learn from your experiences. Any helpful advice would be appreciated - thank you!

I still want something that is autofocus, weather sealed, with a good evf.  Not a big fan of large cameras or large lenses but they do come in handy at times.

1fhf5f0,Q3 Lock Ups,"I have had a Q3 since they launched and have been plagued with lock ups when taking many shots in a row.  When I first reached out I was told that firmware would address this, but the issue is persisting despite multiple firmware updates.   
  
As a wedding photographer, this is a very serious issue - when the lockups happen, the entire stream of photos in the buffer gets lost, and only a single corrupt DNG is left behind. I have lost multiple stunning photos of once in a lifetime moments which cannot be recreated due to this issue.  
  
The error seems to occur when the SD card is unable to write for some reason. The processing light endlessly blinks but I am allowed to take more photos. When switching to the image review however, the camera locks up and up it needs the battery pulled.  
  
It seems to happen when the battery is low, but I am not sure if this is always the case. The issue persists with multiple SD cards, though, I do not believe it is related to the SD card. I have tried countless troubleshooting methods at this point - formatting the card in camera, etc.

1fgdixl,"Leica Store Experience at Harrods, London","I've been an avid Canon user for more than 20 years. I knew about Leica's reputation as being an excellent camera, but that's about it.

I'm from the US and my wife and I were traveling in England this past April. We were shopping at Harrods and I was walking through looking at all the cool technology and electronics Harrods carries. I came across the Leica store and the young man working there asked if he could help me and I responded, ""I'm just looking around. I don't know much about Leica.""

For the next 90 minutes he and I had a great conversation about photography in general and then specifically about Leica cameras and lenses. He was very passionate and knowledgeable. I've always been an SLR/DSLR shooter and wasn't familiar at all with rangefinder cameras.

It was such a pleasant experience learning about Leica's philosophy and how their lenses and cameras are made. He let me try out anything I wanted; it was really eye-opening.

When I reunited with my wife to go to lunch she asked, ""So are you buying a Leica now?"" I told her I definitely wasn't. They're very expensive.

Of course, not more than a month later, after reading and watching everything I could about Leica cameras, I ended up with a Q3. What a fantastic camera! It exceeded my already sky-high expectations after all that research. I use it all the time, only using my Canon for long lens work lately.

1fgic0z,Voigtländer 50mm f2.2 - Early Impressions,"Another user posted about this lens yesterday and prompted me to share my own thoughts and some first pictures.

I went on a trip to Margate, UK and have shared some pictures taken with the lens on an M10.

Very quick review: It’s small, very light and the silver version is a beautiful looking and built lens. I bought this lens to replace my 50mm Summicron v5, as I wanted something lighter, silver and a lens I could save some money on after selling the ‘Cron.

My only two complaints are functional: the focus tab, another reason why I bought the lens, is a little too close to the body of the camera. Your fingers brush off the body when focussing and the ergonomics are a little snug, though easy to get used to. Secondly, the aperture blades are a bit stiffer than the Cron v5, and have two fins either side of the ring. I’ve found these can be tricky to grip when changing aperture, as only the fins are scored in a way to allow for grip, the rest of the ring is smooth aluminium. Takes some getting used to.

Last week I've send my M6 to MPB, they made a fair offer in my mind. I've send the camera in a foam box, especially for sending cameras.

Before sending it I've checked it and seemed fine to me.

After some days I got a lowering of the offer, quite a bit lower. I asked why and they told me that at infinity the finder looks to be off. They can not be sure without doing a role of film.

First of all, seems weird to me that they can not be sure about it. They should be able to test it?

Second, they send back, or agree with the much lowered price or we send it back. The thing Im thinking, if it's really of, then it happened during shipping. I've asked them about it, but no reaction yet.

1fgptsl,Leica Isn't A Camera Company Anymore,"I happened to be in Rome this week traveling and - by complete accident - walked by the Leica store. I spent a bit of time there since I'd never been in one before, and it hit me:  Leica is not a camera company.  They've morphed into a lifestyle brand no different than Apple, Prada, Bulgari, Patek-Philipe *et al*.  ""Lifestyle brand"" means that it's not about what the thing does, but rather exhibiting having the thing for others to see.

It's no accident that this store is in the general area of the Rome high fashion shopping district.

This would explain the various hipster and entertainment types running around strapped with Leica but not actually knowing what they're doing, by all evidences.

Meh.  Gimme my old Ms and IIIf over the new fancy stuff with nosebleed pricing.  I am not about fashion, but function.  (Though I admit the D Lux 8 is a temptress...)

1ffphhj,question of mp,"leica mp 
Hi leica experts,I recently purchased a brand new leica mp and I found it has two problems. 

I found that the mp lens interface after the installation of the lens, there will be a slight shaking. Is this normal? my M10 body installed the same lens,there is no such phenomenon. 

The bottom cover of the mp body is a little uneven, just like the photo. The arc is not too smooth. Is this normal?

1ffacz9,Fashion photography on Leica ,"Hello, I’m a pretty seasoned fashion and lifestyle photographer (this is how Ive made a living for the past 10 or so years)  I’ve always used Sony cameras with interchangeable lenses. But I’m tired of the bulk when I go shoot and when I travel. I’ve been minimizing everything else in my bag. 

I need to do the same with my camera. 

Basically does anyone have any experience with fashion photography and portraiture on the q2 ? has it made it easier or harder, do you ever miss having the ability to change your lenses or has it become sort of a thing you forgot about? Also is it compatible with strobe light controllers? And have you been able to get stunning images as you did before switching to the leica? And is there anything you CANT do that you could before that I should be aware of? 

Also sorry if this has been asked, new to the sub. Thanks in advanced! ",10,0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/1ffacz9/fashion_photography_on_leica/,Illustrious_Road8572,1726167405,9/12/24 18:56,28,,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0
1ffoetp,Crop DoF and Aperture and Focal,"Considering getting a Q3 after \~20 years with Canon and L lenses but would need some help understanding how cropping affects the perceived aperture.

My starting point : cropping doesn't change the DoF - I think we can all agree on that.

Using my favorite DoF calculator, assuming my subject is 2m away, the DoF is 52cm for 28mm at f/1.7. To get such a DoF at 50mm requires f/5.6. Now assuming the subject is 1m away, the DoF is 12cm, which also corresponds to f/5.6 on a 50mm.

I'm primarily shooting wide-open at f/1.2 with a 50mm lens and these narrow aperture equivalences makes me worried. Will my photo look good if I crop them ?

Here’s the setup: I’ll be bringing 2 bodies, with the intention that the SL3 Will be used for wider landscape shots, and the nikon will be more for wildlife, since I do find the AF system better. 

Lens wise, this is where I could use your advice, especially if you have been to Antarctica or similar areas. Here’s what I got:

1. Leica 21mm (I love this lens esp for landscape so unless everyone tells me there’s no point in bringing it, it’s probably going in my backpack).

2. Leica 35mm(SL APO version). I’m tempted to skip this one but open to your thoughts

3. Nikon 24-70 2.8 - I could skip this but that will mean bringing the 35mm, although that would be swapping lens more frequently than I’d hope? 

4. Nikon 70-200 2.8. I’m pretty sure I’ll need this so it’s probably going into the backpack

5. Nikon 180-600. This thing is heavy and I honestly don’t know if it’s needed? Would it be better to just put a 1.4x or 2x extender on the 70-200? I don’t actually own one so that would mean more $

I know it’s not the newest ASPH model of this lens, but I’ve heard great things about the older versions like this too. I however am a little confused on the variations of these though. I know there’s the original versions that were available before they came out with the new production of the ASPH, but it seems like people are selling them at all diff prices. How do I know which version this one is? Does that matter? I’ve seen listings for V1 and VII… this one doesn’t have the grooved aperture ring or a throw ring.

1fcwxih,ADHD and rangefinder adjustment,"Check this out:

I have a Leica M5 with unknown service history. I can see someone tried to adjust rangefinder from the marks made on the screws. I have a service coming in but not before a trip I plan to take my camera to. I have some trouble regarding adjusting this rangefinder for all the lenses. I just got an idea and my ADHD brain would not let me sleep on it.

I have 3 lenses (4th coming) and this is how they behaved before I started my adjustments:

1. CV Color Skopar PII 35 f2.5
- new straight from factory
- flat rangefinder cam
- spot on infinity
- back focus up close

2. Summicron 50 v3
- bought with the camera
- curved rangefinder cam
- does not reach infinity on rf
- spot on up close

3. M-Rokkor 90 v2
- recent purchase
- curved rangefinder cam
- does not reach infinity
- back focus on all ranges

4. (Elmarit-m 135 f2.8 with googles - coming)
- flat rangefinder cam (?)

I decided to adjust the infinity on the camera so that it matches on Summicron and Rokkor. Results:

1. Color skopar:
- spot on up close,
- rf focussing past infinity

2. Summicron:
- a bit of front focus up close (subject is in the rear end of depth of field)
- perfect rf match at infinity

3. Rokkor
- perfect focus close to mid range
- aligning perfectly on infinity

My idea is: I need to adjust linearity of the rf as well changing the length of the focusing arm.

I’m planning to adjust it the following way:

1. Wait for Elmarit 135 ( flat cam, googles, long lens, easy to verify infinity focus)
2. Adjust infinity for Elmarit
3. Color skopar should agree with Elmarit as it’s also flat cam design
4. Adjust linearity until infinity matches on Summicron and Rokkor.
5. Verify infinity match on all lenses
6. Shoot a test roll at close range on focussing target with all lenses on full aperture and closed 2 stops.
7. Hopefully 7 would not be necessary. 

What are your thoughts?

The autothyristor on the Lux Jr seems like it'd be super helpful, and I'm a fan of AA batteries over micro USB charging. It's flatter form factor is nice too, but I've seen reports that it sticks out enough on the rear that it can obstruct the viewfinder.

On the other hand, the Q20II has that really neat detachable transmitter for shooting with the flash in the off-hand, and is GN20 vs GN12 on the Lux Jr. 

I'm kinda torn, I'm not sure how big of an issue the Lux Jr obstructing the viewfinder is, as with GN20 vs GN12 for my use case. And to shoot the Lux Jr off-camera, I'd need to carry around a separate hotshoe to PC sync cable. Has anyone owned both and can share some thoughts on which they preferred or ended up going with?

Hi folks, I’m seeking help with a light leak issue on my M2. It’s happening across multiple rolls, all shot with the same lens (have been sticking to the same lens recently). What I’ve noticed is that the light leak seems to occur only when the subject changes so there’s a delay between shots (i.e., the previous shot sits in the chamber for a while because I don’t advance the film until I’m ready for the next shot, the photos are from two adjacent frames). However, I’m still unsure where the light leak is coming from.

1fbb2xi,50mm F0.95 Noctilux Thoughts and Samples,"The last post I’ve made regarding this lens was somewhat controversial and yes, many of the flaws that were pointed out was true. It’s soft wide open, a whole lot of fringing and field curvature. Also on the last post, I did not correct CA to let everyone who has not experienced the lens to truly see what the lens produced without any sugar coating.
Now, with that in mind, this time I will correct the picture to the best of my ability (not a professional by any means) and explain why this lens is still my favorite and despite having a 35mm Summilux, I still find myself changing to this lens for street photography. 

First two images were portrait shots for my gf and this lens shine, it’s sharp enough to produce great quality while also it’s sharpness was very forgiving for any skin or makeup flaws. Wide open, it’s a must when your background can have people walking by. I explained to her that it’s difficult to focus at max aperture so she would have to try and not change her posture back and forth to quickly. I found it’s best with sharpness at around 1.5m to 2.5m, against any lighting source, it’s just abysmal. 

Now for street photography, it’s a pain in the butt to focus if your eyesight is not great. At wide open, a hair different in focus throw is not forgiving. Therefore, I’ve missed some great moments. The reason why I still bring it for street is because it helps with separation from the busy background in the streets of Asia. Also the extra stop of light means that I could go without flash and be worry about high ISO.

1fbkomy,R lenses are SOLID ,"I was surprised by how heavy these lenses are, especially the 35mm, at least when compared to my Nikon's. They feel crazy solid. I can't wait to try them out, but they arrived earlier than my first Leica, an R8 that should be coming in on Tuesday.

The little 35 is apparently from 1967, going by its serial number, and weighs almost a pound! (Someone please correct me if I have the date wrong.)

I've got a budget of around £1K for a 50mm, I'm looking at a V4 summicron or a V5.

I've read the various threads on here about differences and I'm leaning towards the V4 for the focusing tab (I use a 35mm Ultron with tab already and like it), however I've seen people complain the focusing tab is poorly positioned.

Does anyone have any view on this and whether the V5 is worth considering? (I appreciate the V4 & V5 are the same optically, however the inbuilt hood on V5 doesn't seem highly regarded.

1fb17nu,35 Summicron V3 and 40mm Minolta M-Rokkor,"As I only shoot 35mm focal length I decided that less is more. Sold off all of the lenses and only kept the 40mm Minolta M Rokkor as it’s my favourite lens ever and one of the lenses I have had the longest. Used some of the fund to get a 35mm Summicron V3 because I needed a 35mm back. 

Before I got the Summicron I had already prepared mentally that the Minolta would be pretty much on par with the more expensive Summicron in terms of performance. They are both 6 elements in 4 group. Comparing the two now, I stand corrected. The Minolta is tact sharp and almost just as good (maybe the 35mm ‘cron has a bit more micro contrast).  I can’t find any difference between them when seeing the pictures side by side. The Minolta is also smaller as well and 3 times cheaper. 

The only difference (not really a problem in real life use) is the Minolta brings up the 50mm frameline on a M but this isn’t the men’s problem. It’s easy to compose with the 50mm FL and just have to visualize a bit more when composing. 

All in all, can’t go wrong with the Minolta (or the equivalent 40mm Summicron-C). My honest opinion is that it is just as good as the 35mm ‘cron.

1fbaoc4,M10 vs. Q-P exposure,"I recently got a M10 from MPB and I'm not happy with my photos. ""A poor craftsman blames his tools"" and whatnot, but I have really been struggling in ways I didn't with my Q-P, and it's not (just) the focus. Just from a quick example shot at my desk here, I shot both images at the same settings (ISO 200, SS 125, f/2) yet the M10 is underexposed. I feel like there's also some kind of weird curve boost on the M10 to the point where it's somewhat detrimental, not necessarily in the example pictures, but in general. Most notably in bright light with some shadows, like in the afternoon.

  
I also understand that ISO isn't exactly a set value and it can vary from sensor to sensor, maker to maker, model to model. To get a comparable image to the Q-P I had to shoot the M10 I had to shoot the M10 at ISO 800, which seems like too much.

I recently got some brassing on my m11-p. It's only visible on the ON switch a tiny little bit on the iso dial.I wonder if it comes from storing the camera in my camera bag and undoing, since I am used to doing this frequently on longer hikes. Using the hyperlite camera pod small, which is a snug fit.. anyway I just wanted to share this.I think it's sweet and I didn't know the small buttons were made out not brass :-)

  
Also I wanted to ask this community on recommendations for an L to M mount adapter. I can not afford the Leica original one. I will buy an Sl2-s soon, since a friend sells it for a good price and I figured It would compliment the M good. Also want to get into filming for some projects. 

  
What are your thoughts on the Sl2-s in 2024? I almost never use the 60MP on the M11-P. Is a 24MP sensor outdated?

I've been playing around with this setup: an SL2-S turned into a kind of Q, by means of the Sigma 35mm f/2 DG DN and a Q-style hood from Hoage.

Pros:

* Built like a tank
* 35mm focal length
* Super-sharp and beautiful lens (the Sigma is excellent, IMO)
* Real aperture ring (unlike many other L-mount lenses)
* Crazy good low-light performance
* Incredible viewfinder
* You can take off the lens and put on a 70-200, or 50mm, or whatever else you want
* The shutter sound is sublime
* Giant grip
* I bought both camera and lens heavily used and the combo was cheaper than a used Q2.

Cons:

* It weighs a lot
* 24mp (although maybe not really a con)
* The viewfinder kind of digs into your side when the camera is on a strap
* No marked dial for shutter speed
* No zoom to crop (although you can mount an actual zoom)
* The aperture ring turns the wrong way (all of Sigma's lenses have zoom and aperture rings that go the opposite direction compared to Leica lenses)
* It's chunky!

I'm an M shooter fundamentally, but this has been fun to have around the house, and I'm warming up to the SL2-S, having used it in the rain and to photograph my kid's athletic feats from afar.

1f9ybl3,Leica vs. Life: Family-Friendly Camera Setup Advice,"Hey Reddit,

I could really use some advice as I’m stuck on my next camera move.

I’ve been a hobbyist photographer for years, starting with a Sony a7rii and a mix of zooms and primes (24-70, 70-200, 35, and 55). It was my go-to travel setup, but over time, the bulk made me stop carrying it, so I sold off some lenses and started dreaming about Leica.

I ended up buying an M10 and, during a trip to Wetzlar, also picked up an M6 and a 35mm Summilux. The M10 had issues, so I got a refund and kept the M6, which I love—especially how film slows me down to really work on a shot. But film’s expensive, and now I can’t shoot as much as I’d like.

Here’s the dilemma: My wife and I are expecting our first kid, and I want a practical camera with autofocus for those quick, everyday moments (I haven’t mastered the rangefinder yet).

I’m debating between:

	•	Leica Q3 (leaning towards this)
	•	Leica M10-R (and just practice like crazy before the baby’s running)
	•	Sony a7cr with a pancake lens
	•	M10-R + Fuji X100V/Ricoh GR (for versatility)

I’ll keep the a7rii for fast-moving events like sports, but for daily life with a kid, I’m stuck.

Leica shooters and parents—how did you handle photography once kids came into the picture? Any advice on which option makes the most sense for capturing those moments?

1f9s8hk,Leica SL2 Focus Peaking and Focus in General Questions,"Hello All, 

Not too long back I purchased a SL2 and while setting it up, I turned on focus peaking (red) to help guide me when focusing since my eyesight is not the best. I have yet to see the focus peaking and am wondering what I am missing. I should note that I have a combination of Leica and Sigma SL lenses. 

Today I received the Leica M to L adapter (18771) as I have a number of M-series lenses that I would like to use on the SL2. Having tried it out, I am loving utilizing the M-glass on the SL2. This will enable me to travel more often with the SL2 when space is minimal. All that aside, I am also not seeing any focus peaking using Leica or 3rd-party glass on the SL2. 

In the end, I realize that this is probably something I am overlooking. Could it be that focus peaking only works while the camera is in manual mode? 

...I just tried that with a Summarit-M 90mm and it too did not give me focus peaking. 

I'd love some helpful guidance. I have noticed that the viewfinder and live view are just beautiful and that focus peaking might not altogether be necessary, but it is a feature I like to use and use on my other Leica's. 

One other SL question. I believe if you set the camera in manual mode, you can utilize the joystick for focusing. Is this correct? I think this would be my preferred way to shoot on this camera. Obviously it would not work with manual lenses, but with my Leica and Sigma SL-lenses it should. 

Thank you for anything you'd be willing to share. I continue to love my Leica journey. ",2,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/1f9s8hk/leica_sl2_focus_peaking_and_focus_in_general/,iamchrisjett,1725557470,9/5/24 17:31,6,,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0

1f96jtq,Mr Ding 35 f1.8 Pactron on M10-P photos,"Well, here are some photos with the long awaited Mr Ding Optics 35mm f1.8. A Chinese take on the highly regarded V4 35mm Summicron. 

My thoughts-

Disclaimer- I have never used or purchased a Chinese lens before. So my comparison is against Cosina Zeiss / Voigtlander & Leica. 

Build quality: it’s fine. If Leica is a 9/10, Cosina at its best is an 8/10 I would rate this lens at a 6/6.5. 
It’s has some heft to it because it’s brass. 
The aperture ring is good. The clicks are certain, there is some play at 1.8 & 16. 
Focus is pretty good, the weight of it is right on, but not quite as smooth as Voigtlander or Leica. But again it’s pretty good, not problematic. 
Together the focusing with its tab and aperture ring make shooting easy, I didn’t find myself fiddling with either or being uncertain during my first few hours shooting with it. 

Finish- this is probably the weak point of this lens. I believe this it’s black painted brass. The paint looks good but the lettering could be better, there’s some bleed and the yellow is kinda thin, so you can see the black behind it. Again I think it’s ‘fine’. 
For some strange reason the finish and lettering on the lens hood is much better than my copy of the lens. So take from that what you will. If the lens had the same detail I’d be happy. 


Optical quality- in a word, it’s great. This lens delivers optically in my opinion. I’m no pixel peeping lens scientist but for sure the IQ is there. Wide open it looses contrast and has a perceivable character which I really like. Stepped down from 5.6 to 16 it’s very sharp and the contrast is excellent. I won’t say too much more, just take a look at the pictures which a very minimally edited DNG out of the M10. (For the wide open shots just check the corners and you’ll be able to tell those are them.)


All in I’m happy! I took a small gamble on this lens and I think it paid off. I wanted a compact 35 and this delivers, certainly on the optical front. Perhaps if you go for the silver finish you may find yourself very surprised by this lens. I really think this is a good product, and the guys over there are trying to do a good job. Seems clear to me most of their investment was in the optics, which I respect. But given we’re dealing with Leica, fit, finish and attention to detail are going to be scrutinized perhaps more than normally.",24,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1f96jtq,kosta421,1725488855,9/4/24 22:27,6,,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0

1f8apu0,Information on M6 Classic circuit board,"Given the demand for M6's, how long they've been around & how straightforward the meter is I'm surprised people haven't worked on a replacement assembly. 
Is there just not enough demand for it to make sense? 

The best pictures of the meter I can find:
- [Cutaway illustration.](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/50d0bee7e4b07abde4169be1/1458073671936-0EX5430QHSMVSUVQUBHE/leica+M6?format=2500w)

- [Some pictures of flexboard assemblies](https://www.cameraworks-uk.com/post/is-your-leica-m6-slowly-becoming-an-m4-p-no-more-light-meter-pcb-s). Here Cameraworks implies they'll get around to designing a replacement sometime. Maybe this is the most compelling evidence the rabbit hole is not worth going down yet.
- [Cutaway display models](https://lavidaleica.com/content/overview-m-system)

The electronics are simple enough that from these pictures you can infer almost exactly how the meter works and what it would take to create a replacement:
 - The ISO dial back flap with its 3 contacts must be a potentiometer. I doubt it fails often, but anyway thin radial pots are available off-the-shelf.
 - Shutter speed dial looks like a voltage divider and also seems unlikely to fail. Notice there's 13 pads correspond to the 13 shutter dial positions, and each pad is wired to a different point in a series of resistors. Voltage is likely being read by an ADC on the microcontroller.
 - **I can't find the electrical contact that turns the meter on when the shutter is half-pressed. Does anyone know where this is?** This is also a very basic mechanism and an unlikely failure point. 
 - **I can't find a clear photo of the indicator LEDs. Can anyone help with this?** Unsure how often those go bad. If we're to take the cutaway illustration literally it looks like 3 wires: ground, one lead to > and another to <. Since those lights are so small and precise in form it would be pretty annoying (but far from impossible) to recreate a replacement. 
 - If the orange flexboard gets corroded, it isn't that hard to order replacements. It would just take some scans and patience in a vector graphics editor.
- This leaves the main, likely point of failure as the PCB on the battery compartment. If one really has to re-design it, even this shouldn't require much ingenuity:
  - The heart could be any ultra-low-power MCU (STM32L0xxxx for instance). It would take several inputs:
    1. MCU interrupt pin gets triggered by shutter half-press, wakes the MCU for 10s. 
    1. ADC channel to read shutter dial voltage divider
    1. ADC channel to read ISO dial voltage divider
    1. ADC channel to read a pot on the mainboard for calibrating the meter/adding ev offset. Maybe we even already have a pot to use here, built-in: notice there's a pot on the underside of the shutter speed dial's board. 
    1. The MCU talks to an offboard light meter via I2C (TI OPT3001 for instance), replacing the photodiode
    1. Digital outputs drive the LEDs.
    1. Need a few decoupling caps and resistors to support the MCU, I2C bus, LEDs, voltage dividers. 
  - Once this is working on a breadboard you'd draw up a PCB of the right shape. OPT3001 surface-mounted on its own tiny pcb with breakout pads, free-wired to the mainboard. Might be able to surface mount everything with a toaster oven or hot plate.

I'm not about to gut my functional M6 to do this and there's a lot of design work to get to that point anyway. It's also possible the same mainboard design could be used in other cameras, like my meter-inop Leica CL. Am I taking crazy pills?

1f88plr,Epson R-D1 or Leica m8?,"Hi guys! Im a film photographer from the Netherlands and I am trying to find a digital rangefinder camera that costs around 1000-1500 euro's.

I was thinking about the Epson R-D1 or the Leica m8. Both are beautiful but completely different. The rangefinder from the epson is 1:1 but it has lower quality and a higher crop factor.

anyone that has experience with any of these(or both?)

Epsons are sadly hard to find.

ty!

I was able to find a fuji x100 original for now. I bought it because I need to stop with my gear acquisition syndrome. I'm going to use it to up my street photography and if I ever get bored of it I will circle back to this thread  : )

I decided on the 40mm Summicron-C because I love the focal length but also loving how compact it is. Hopefully the results are equally impressive.

I get a little overwhelmed when trying to catch a moment and I’m not ready to set focus and/or adjust my exposure quickly. But I think I’m getting better little by little. 

Did I mention I’ve never used a rangefinder….do you all just trust the rangefinder patch? lol. I understand how it works but man I don’t think I’ll feel awesome about it until I get my first roll developed.

Overall I do think the shooting experience is great and straightforward.

And man does this camera feel awesome to hold! Some of the paint has gracefully worn off and I thought about buying a half case but it looks pretty awesome without one.

1f6ihlt,Leica M11 - Really disappointed with USB C Battery Charging and Leica App - Two things I thought would be really convenient but are just not,"Per title, I get the Leica M11 is no longer new, but need to say - I feel the USB C and Leica App connectivity are just so amateur for a company that asks you to spend so much money for them. And the fact they both still suck after all these firmware updates just annoys me more.

For context I’m annoyed. I’m on vacation, it’s 9AM and I usaully have my coffee at this time. Instead I”m sitting in my hotel room trying to figure out why the heck my $200 Leica battery isn’t charging.

I’ll start with the battery. I have two now and one of them is just refusing to charge with USB C. I’ve tried different cables, different adaptors, different plugs. One of the batteries is just fine and charges no issue. The other? Just flashes a “charge battery soon” message and then leaves me to decipher these green and orange light flashes somehow. So frustrating. I bought into the USB C hype because I thought it would be like any other USB C product I own and well… just charge!

And then there’s the Leica App. Oh wow I can shoot and for special photos pull that straight to my phone or iPad to edit! That was the theory anyway, in reality it’s such a buggy mess.

It never seems to work how I want it to. I’ll try to connect and get all sorts of errors. If I’m lucky I can download a photo. The remote shutter trigger works once out of about every 10 tries. And god forbid you leave it In performance mode, you’re going to drain the battery so fast that eventually you’ll be back at the top… Complaining about the sucky $200 battery!

Anyway total rant post. But while the actual camera is pretty fantastic, the tech side of Leica’s M11 is a total letdown.

Anyway I’m leaving to get a coffee - battery is still at 0% btw.

My thought process behind this is 1) the Q3 has better IQ, and gives extra room to crop in that I haven't found on the Fuji, 2) the Q should do better with low light if I get a chance at northern lights, and 3) I have shiny object syndrome 😅.

Downsides: if I can't rely on the jpegs I'll have to muddle my way through editing (would shoot raws as a backup ofc), and no built in ND might mean a bad time on the rare sunny day.

I’m in the middle of a trip to Portugal, and after cleaning my camera today, I realized that some “stains” appeared in the viewfinder. 

While looking through it, it doesn’t seem to affect my vision much, but it bothers me, as I don’t recall seeing it in any other camera I’ve ever owned. 

I’m always careful with my stuff and use a dry Q-tip to clean. Then, I put a drop of water on it and a smooth tissue, and nothing worked. I tried a tiny drop of neutral soap on a tip, but nothing. 

If I touch it with my finger, the coating feels delaminating, so it’s an outside issue, not an inner one. 

I suspect this might be a chemical reaction between my sweat and the sunscreen I've used on my face. It's also boiling here, but it's a bummer that an expensive camera like this has this issue. 

I still wanted to try isopropyl alcohol and the LensPen tool, but I don't have them with me now. 

Has anyone experienced the same with the Q3? What did the Leica service center tell you? 

I believe my warranty is still active, as it is three years old in the Netherlands, where I bought it after registering. I will contact them if nothing works. 

I still have my insurance, which wouldn't cover this kind of stuff, I believe.

1f2pw7x,Leica SL Lenses - Leica vs Sigma - a discussion.,"Hello All, 

I recently picked up an SL2 that I intend on using with my M-series lenses, although I do want a few everyday lenses for autofocus needs. 

The first lens I picked up was the new Sigma 24-70 F/2.8 DG DN II Art lens. So far, it has impressed me with a great build quality and wonderful images, it is more along the lines of what I would expect the Leica Vario-Elmarit-SL 24-70 F/2.8 ASPH to be. 

That said, I did have a question on this lens, Sigma states that this lens has a splash-resistant structure and a water repellent front coating, while Leica states that their lens has weather sealing. Is this just their own terminology for the same thing, or is there truly a difference? I don't go out of the way to shoot in inclement weather, although I always want to be prepared for it. 

The second lens I picked up was the Leica 100-400 with the Leica 1.4x Extender. This I got as I am selling off my a7RIV system and I use the longer lenses to take moon shots and for wildlife. It was a quick decision, I got it for a great price and I am happy to have this focal length out of the way. 

The third lens I purchased was the Sigma 105 F/2.8 DG DN Macro Art lens. Here too, I am replacing the macro off my Sony. I often take macros and it is the one thing I wish I had for my M10 Monochrom and perhaps one of the main driving forces for me to purchase the Q3. 

As for prime lenses, I have 9 lenses for my M10 Monochrom, so I am good there, BUT... I am wanting to get your opinion on the one SL-based (autofocus) prime to take with me if I went out for a day around the city with only one lens - think street photography and casual shots. I am thinking of a focal length around 24-35mm and would love to hear your suggestions and possibly see images.

And finally, from what I have read, I am under the impression that Sigma is manufacturing Leica's lenses, or at least providing components, and that their build and image quality is pretty much (although not exactly) the same, whereas Panasonic, who also utilizes the L-mount has a lens that offers very good image quality, but the housing might be a bit more plastic. Is this correct? Are there any other lens manufacturers that you like and that I should consider? 

As always, thank you in advance, my Leica journey continues and I am looking forward to shooting more with the SL2. ",4,0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/1f2pw7x/leica_sl_lenses_leica_vs_sigma_a_discussion/,iamchrisjett,1724786961,8/27/24 19:29,7,,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0

I'm looking for a small bag that I can wear around my waist. I'm going on a holiday, and I want to wear a backpack during the day, but I want to be able to reach for my two cameras easily and quickly while walking around.

I'm looking for something that could fit the following things:

Sony A7 mk1 with TTArtisan 50mm 1.4. Can be considered a Leica M size-wise-ish.  
Leica M2 with Nokton 35mm 1.4

When putting the two cameras flat next to each other (with the bodies nearly touching), I've measured 15cm height \* 23cm width \* \~9cm depth

Now I'm looking for a comfortable waist/belt bag where those two cameras could fit. I'm not necessarily interested in wearing any other items with it. Some padding would be nice if possible. If possible I want to order the bag from EU at least.  It has to be comfortable for waist wearing. Budget is around 100 euros but for the ideal bag I can consider a higher price.

What I think is that somehow fanny packs look a bit more comfortable around the waist but two cameras with small lenses might not fit. The Peak Design does not look that comfortable when wearing around the waist due to its height but I might be wrong!

I've checked out but not ordered:

* Peak Design Everyday sling 3L
* Lululemon All Day Essentials 2.5L
* Think Tank Mirrorless Mover 25 V2
* The North Face Pack Unisex
* Wotancraft Pilot 3.5L (Is this even usable as a waist pack...?)

1f19nce,Owners thoughts: M2 vs M3,"Hi all, just wanted to share my thoughts on these two cameras. I imagine there are a lot of people here who have had to decide between the two.

To start, I have owned A LOT of cameras, including: Leica M3/ M2/ M4-2/ M6/ M6ttl Mamiya 6 and 7, Nikon F2 FM2n and FM, Olympus XA etc. Just saying that I’ve experienced a lot of different camera styles and am an experienced film shooter. 

I’ve owned my M3 for about a year and a half. This particular M3 has been in my family for over 60 years. My grandfather bought it new in 1961, and after he passed, I inherited it and had it CLA’d by red dot in Portland. I have used it a decent amount since.

I bought the M2 because it has been difficult for me to bring the M3 places. With it being in my family so long, I’m constantly scared of losing it, or accidentally leaving it somewhere. For this reason, I really wanted a camera without that family connection that I could take everywhere with me guilt-free.

It felt silly to buy a second m3, so opted for a m2 instead.

Honestly, I absolutely love it. The M3 is special, but the M2 feels just as special in its own way. The viewfinder is almost as bright, and best of all, the winding mechanism feels just as good. I really think the mechanical advance of the m2/m3 is one of the best mechanical feelings ever made. I know this is a hot topic, but I actually love the dial counter that only came on the m2. It really makes it feel like the camera was just made for one thing, to take pictures without any added drama. 

The frame lines come down to preference. I shoot 50mm most of the time. Nothing can beat the fat 50mm frame lines of the m3. They are amazing and super bright. However, I find the .72 viewfinder of the m2 works a little better for me when wearing glasses because you can see the shot without having to jam your face into the camera. I also enjoy that I can see what isn’t in frame to help align my shot. Without glasses, the m3 is a little quicker to find focus at 50mm than the m2. If you shoot 90mm frequently, m3 is the way to go.

Compared to other leicas both the m2 and m3 feel far superior in build. The m4 is another great camera, but I think the viewfinder, winder, and film advance are just more solid on the m3/2. The M6 build feels a little better than the m4 imo, but for double the price, you are really just getting a light meter and a camera that feels more 80’s than 60’s (I do love the m6 though). The m6 ttl is great too, although I never liked the plastic top dial. Nothing, and I mean nothing, beats the feeling of advancing the film in a m3 or m2. 

 Both of these cameras are awesome, and it totally comes down to preference, but for anyone looking, don’t assume that the m3 is the better camera. They are both amazing in their own way.

I figured I'd try it out for the obvious reasons: weather sealing, EVF, autofocus, zooms, telephoto action, ultrawides, video.

In complex, multi-person scenes (i.e., ordinary family life), I find myself fighting with the autofocus; I don't like the jet-fighter-HUD EVF vibe, with all the flashing white and yellow boxes. I like being totally in control, as I am with an M. I'd heard a lot about the manual focus experience, and it's good—but not as direct or enjoyable as the rangefinder, especially for wider lenses; it also seems to me that I'm faster on the M system, even with my most ""difficult"" lens, a 50/1.2.

The SL2-S itself is big and heavy. And I'm also befuddled by the lenses: the best SL glass—24-90, APO Summicrons—is huge. I'm just used to the M system, where the design philosophy keeps everything small.  I'm also not sure how I feel about spending Leica money on electronic autofocus lenses, as opposed to mechanical lenses that will last forever. Overall, I'm drawn to character over sharpness—my main M lenses are the 35 Steel Rim and 50 Noctilux f/1.2 reissues—and there don't seem to be many options for that in L-mount. The 50 Lux SL is beautiful, but giant.

I live an active life in a coastal environment, and I'm always outside, photographing in rain, snow, sand, etc. I don't take studio photographs; my main work is documentary in nature, fast-moving, and technically not that demanding. I take a lot of pictures of my growing kids, but also while out reporting stories as a journalist, sometimes in nature. It seemed like an SL2-S and 24-70 or 24-90 might be a good idea. I sort of imagined a future where I'd have a 24-90 and a 35mm APO Summicron as my rough weather / sports and action / landscaping / trip to Iceland kit. 

But now that I have the camera in hand (with a Leica 24-70, M-L adapter, and Sigma 45 f/2.8), I'm coming around to the view that, for the cost of the camera and lenses, I could simply replace one of my Ms if it breaks due to bad weather. And in other areas where the SL2-S excels—like shooting my 90mm or 135mm lenses through the big EVF—I'm starting to think I'd rather go back to accepting the limitations of the M system in exchange for its ultra-small form factor and simplicity of operation. Maybe I can live with the Visoflex!

Or possibly these are just growing pains, and a week or two isn't long enough to really get to know a camera, and I've drunk the M-system Kool-Aid. Should I persevere? Have any other serious M shooters out there experienced something similar, then found satisfaction with an SL camera?",6,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/1f1krsw/should_i_keep_my_sl2s/,mrjosh72,1724667727,8/26/24 10:22,26,,FALSE,1724668107,0,0,0

1f1hpba,Usage of lenses with <0.7m MFD on film bodies,"Hi everyone, 

after pondering about it for a few months, I have decided to buy myself an early birthday present (when if not now xD) and splurge some cash on an M6, after I found one (relatively) locally, in what appears great condition. 

Now I'm in the market for a first M mount lens, 35mm to begin with. After researching a bit on various options, it seems to me that the Voigtlander Nokton 35mm f1.5 would be very versatile - not a large form factor, has a focusing tab, sharp stopped down and the option for a large aperture if dealing with low light separation. Also, the bokeh seems quite nice for a 35mm.

The only thing that stays my hand in making the final decision is the fact that the lens focuses under 0.7m. I wanted to ask for your experiences in using lenses that focus closer than the RF is coupled - how big of an annoyance in usage was it? Have you managed to reliably focus closer than the minimum RF coupling with practice? 

 One of the things I would like to practice is zone focusing for street (or at least prefocusing so that I need to adjust the focus only slightly after raising the camera to my eye) , and the lower lens MFD seems like it could make this process harder as I don't have a mechanical stop at the RF minimum distance.

I would love to hear about all of your experiences in this matter if you are willing to share. ",6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Leica/comments/1f1hpba/usage_of_lenses_with_07m_mfd_on_film_bodies/,BleuMisanthrope,1724654721,8/26/24 6:45,11,,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0

1f1csor,Q2 or D’Lux 8,"Hi I’m looking to get a new camera, cannot decided to get the D’Lux 8 (baby Q) or second hand Q2.

I’m not really new to photography but is new to the Leica system. I only tried my friend first Q once or twice. Perviously I’m shooting mainly on Nikon and Fujifilm with my last camera a X-pro1 and Fuji-xt30. I have stopped photography for a while but would like to jump back in.

Couldn’t decide between the Q series or the D’Lux series mainly as I have not use a Leica system and also a full frame camera before. For the Q2 I’m looking at a second hand but not a Q3 as cost for it is quite steep and Q2 is already pushing my budget. As how did a D’Lux 8 come into my consideration mainly is from how “simple” it is to use it and also for me to try if I would love the Leica family. 

 From reviews I understand that D’Lux8 does not have the “Leica looks/colours”, is that true ? Would it be better for me to just start with the Q2? 

Lastly should I just save up and get a Q3 directly?
